              " 'content': [\"Gautier Houba/Travel + Leisure \\n Iconic canals, centuries-old townhomes, cobblestone lanes, and flower-adorned bridges. Amsterdam is as pretty as a postcard with charm in spades. It’s also one of the rare places that attracts history buffs, luxury-minded travelers, couples seeking romance, and backpackers alike. \\n Besides cultural attractions like the Anne Frank House and Rijksmuseum, the Dutch capital has leafy parks, hip shops, and an enduring sense of the past that thankfully never fades. With world-class museums, bicycle tours, and a thriving arts scene, it's really just a matter of culling it down to a select few activities. Since wandering around the city’s quaint streets and sitting outside at a sidewalk cafe is so appealing, you won’t want to cram too much into your daytime itinerary. \\n In fact, Tesa Totengco, a member of Travel + Leisure’s A-List Travel Advisor Board and the founder and CEO of Travels with Tesa, told T+L that what makes Amsterdam stand out from other European cities is “Their iconic canal network and how walkable the city is if you’re not biking.” \\n On the F&B front, this burgeoning culinary mecca boasts world-class restaurants that make every meal a gourmet adventure. When the sun goes down, there’s no shortage of things to do either (think: cozy speakeasies, bustling bars, and plenty of nightclubs). Lastly, you can’t talk about Amsterdam without mentioning “coffee shops” — and not the kind that strictly brews espresso. \\n Totengco says these “coffee shops and the city’s long-established attitudes towards tolerance and diversity,” make the city truly special. She notes that “Amsterdam is also one of the earliest places to adopt progressive policies regarding marijuana, sex work, and same-sex marriage.” \\n Simply put: whatever your idealized version of a European getaway entails, Amsterdam won’t disappoint. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Perched on the Prinsengracht canal, the Pulitzer Amsterdam proffers a picture-perfect location. The storybook charm continues inside. Guests are greeted by an eye-catching display of fresh-cut blooms in the entryway. Heritage-rich touches adorn the lobby, rooms, and suites. There’s also a delicious restaurant called Jansz and a lovely garden for enjoying tea or a glass of wine. The Pulitzer is so spectacular that it was voted one of the best resorts in Amsterdam by T+L readers. \\n This high-end option housed a former music conservatory that’s right by the Van Gogh Museum, Conservatorium Hotel comes up big in both the location and aesthetics department. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more impressive architectural feat than the property’s jaw-dropping glass atrium. For a bit of R&R, book a treatment at Akasha Holistic Wellbeing.\\xa0The Conservatorium Hotel was also voted one of the best resorts in Amsterdam by T+L readers. \\n A traveler favorite, the Ambassador Hotel wins rave reviews for its central location and prize-winning views. A mix of contemporary and traditional design, rooms feature modern artwork, antique furnishings, and striking chandeliers. Past guests also tout the friendly staff and reasonable rates. \\n More than just a respite to rest your weary head, The Hoxton, Amsterdam is a place to see and be seen. A lobby bar that encourages mingling, quirky rooms, and interesting pop-ups gives it a vibe that’s simultaneously uber-hip and approachable. The welcoming atmosphere makes travelers from all walks of life feel like they’re part of the “in crowd.” \\n For travelers who prefer a boutique stay with a sophisticated, modern ambiance and ample plush perks, The Dylan most certainly delivers. Rooms beckon well-heeled wanders with a variety of room sizes and layouts and a palette of muted hues and Aesop toiletries. The tranquil courtyard is an ideal spot to unwind after a day of sightseeing. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n Late spring is arguably the best season to visit Amsterdam. The forecast of mild temperatures couldn’t be more perfect for biking around the city and exploring the surrounding countryside. Starting in early April, the legendary tulips begin to bloom, which lures travelers from around the world. The famous King's Day carnival, held on April 27, is another major draw. \\n Totengco agrees that spring is the best time to visit Amsterdam. She recommends booking a trip “between April and May when the tulips are in full bloom and one can visit the Keukenhof gardens.” \\n Because the aptly nicknamed “Venice of the North” enjoys an oceanic climate, it never gets super hot. While the rest of Europe flocks to the beaches of Santorini and Saint-Tropez, we love the idea of a summer city break in Amsterdam. You might have to contend with a few more fellow travelers, but it’s certainly not going to be an impediment to a fantastic trip. \\n Early fall is marked by pleasant temperatures and plenty of opportunities to spend time outdoors. Don’t write off wintertime. Sure, the days are short and there’s a frosty chill in the air, however, the sparkling frozen canals, holiday spirit, and lack of crowds make it a really special time. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n The Netherlands has birthed many famous artists, with Vincent Van Gogh chief among them. Works by the tortured artist are on display at his namesake museum. If you hope to see “Sunflowers” on your trip to Amsterdam, be sure to buy tickets ahead of time. \\n Widely regarded as Amsterdam’s most significant attraction, the Anne Frank House invites visitors to learn about the life of the Jewish diarist who hid from the Nazis during WWII through a collection of her writing, photos, videos, and personal items. Keep in mind that tickets sell out months in advance. \\n Located in Amsterdam-Zuid, Vondelpark is a sprawling 47-hectare urban green space featuring an open-air theatre, playground, shaded areas, ponds, and cycling paths. When the sun comes out, it instantly becomes a hotspot for afternoon picnics and sunbathing. \\n Michela Sieman/Travel + Leisure \\n By now you’ve likely gathered that Amsterdam abounds with incredible museums. But art and history enthusiasts should make a beeline to the Rijksmuseum, which chronicles 800 years of heritage through the works of masters like Rembrandt and period artifacts.\\xa0In fact, Totengco said it is the “preeminent museum on Dutch art and the masters Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Van Gogh.” Noting that “If you only had time for one museum, this should be it.” \\n No trip to Amsterdam would be complete without a canal cruise. It’s truly the best way to see “Venice of the North.” You can purchase a ticket with Flagship Amsterdam, operator of the highly regarded Amsterdam Open Boat Canal Cruise, or opt for something a bit more intimate and romantic like a private vessel operated by the Pulitzer Amsterdam. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n A quirky shop that advertises its wares as “modern curiosities and vintage finds,” The Otherist has built a business on oddities. Peruse the shelves of framed butterflies, one-of-a-kind jewelry, and porcelain skulls. You’re bound to stumble upon something totally unique. \\n Vanilia is the place to pick up Dutch-designed, sustainable basics — sweaters, denim, skirts, and wrap dresses — that are destined to become wardrobe staples. Bonus: every time someone at home doles out a compliment, you can reply, “Oh, I bought this in Amsterdam.” \\n Collectors of bygone-era treasures (and just generally anyone with interest in the past) should check out Antiekcentrum Amsterdam, the largest antique market in the Netherlands. A huge range of jewelry, art, ceramics, and homewares are up for grabs. \\n Fans of aged Appenzeller, raw milk gouda, and chèvre rejoice! Whether you’re in the mood for Dutch or imported cheese, De Kaaskamer is sure to satisfy your cravings. This storied retailer also sells a selection of tasty meats, salads, tapenades, wine, and beer. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Housed in a bright and airy glass-domed space, De Kas wows with multi-course tasting menus. In fact, it was the top restaurant recommended by Totengco who called it a “chic greenhouse conservancy serving garden-to-table Mediterranean fare.” Much of the produce comes from the on-site greenhouse — which patrons can tour before or after eating. Pro tip: It’s easier to snag a reservation for lunch. Plus, the midday light is sublime for snapping food photos. \\n Dutch cuisine flies under the radar. Restaurant Floreyn gives travelers a taste of local flavors. We dare anyone not to fall in love with the rotating menu of seasonal house specialties. Oh, and in case you were still on the fence, the wine pairing is totally worth it. \\n Bakeries are a dime a dozen in Amsterdam. But De Laatste Kruimel is something truly special. This neighborhood gem delights visitors and locals with its French toast and bread pudding. Don’t sleep on the more savory offerings like quiche either. \\n A delicious tradition dating back decades, Vleminckx de Sausmeester has perfected the art of fried potatoes. It’s worth waiting in line for the chance to dig into perfectly crispy spuds. Don’t forget the homemade sauces. Curry ketchup, anyone? \\n Dutch pancakes are a full-blown phenomenon. Upstairs Pannenkoekenhuis serves sweet and savory varieties of this beloved dish in a quirky second-door space that’s brimming with charm. Can’t decide what to order? You can't go wrong with the best-selling brie and honey pannenkoek. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Most visitors arrive in Amsterdam via plane. The Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS), also known as Schiphol Airport, is the Netherlands’ main international airport. The airport is extremely close to the center of the city, with airport shuttles running between the airport and the city center every 15 minutes (bus 397). Once you’re in the city center (or Centrum) you can walk or bike almost everywhere. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Postcards of Amsterdam typically showcase Grachtengordel. Encircled by the city’s main canals — Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht — this winsome zone is known for its colorful townhomes, waterfront eateries, upmarket hotels, and attractions like the Anne Frank House. \\n Arguably the most in-demand neighborhood in Centrum — or, more accurately, all of Amsterdam — Jordaan is an irresistibly beautiful maze of narrow lanes, canals, high-end boutiques, and cozy cafes. \\n Museumkwartier has a wide range of museums (the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum, to name a few), as well as the Concertgebouw. It’s also home to many fine jewelry stores and designer outposts. \\n Just south of Amsterdam's city center lies De Pijp. This former working-class neighborhood turned hipster haven has an urban industrial edge and bohemian flair. Go savor the flavors of Albert Cuyp Markt and stay for the cool brunch spots, retro pubs, and contemporary ateliers. \\n If walls, err cobblestones, could talk, De Wallen would have tales to tell. Amsterdam’s infamous Red Light District entices travelers with the promise of peep shows, sex shops, cannabis cafes, and nightclubs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Forget about renting a car, Totengco says, “Walking is honestly the best way to get around the city.” If you prefer to do as the locals do, download \\u200ethe Donkey Republic app to rent a bike or pop into a local rental shop. \\n If you have mobility challenges or visited Amsterdam during a bout of poor weather, she said, “the tram system is also efficient and easy to navigate.” If you’re planning to take public transportation and want to see all the major sites (including a canal cruise), Totengco recommends buying the I Amsterdam City Card which includes unlimited use of the city’s public transport (GVB), bike rental, a canal cruise, and over 70 museums, including the Rijksmuseum. \\n Trams: Amsterdam’s iconic blue-and-white trams remain a reliable and economical way to get around the city center (3.40 Euros an hour or 9 Euros a day). Most lines convene at Amsterdam Central Station, the city’s main transportation hub. \\n Buses: The bus system is quite extensive and efficient with over 40 lines. Catching a flight? Hop aboard the airport shuttle, which runs between Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and the city center every 15 minutes. Planning an evening out on the town? Whereas the trams and metros operate between 6 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., night buses come in clutch for after-dark transport needs. \\n Metros: The metro system comprises five routes and serves 39 stations, making it best for accessing the outlying suburbs. \\n Ferries: Like trams, buses, and metros, Amsterdam’s ferries are also operated by GVB. Connections across the Noordzeekanaal (North Sea Canal) are under 2 Euros, while boats crossing the IJ River are free of charge for pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders. \\n Rideshare: If you’re sticking to Amsterdam’s Centrum, driving isn’t really necessary. However, it’s easy to hail an Uber to take you to some of the outer boroughs. \\n Trains: The Netherlands has an impressive national railway network. For day trips to the countryside and neighboring cities, trains from Amsterdam Central Station are a convenient and easy-to-navigate option. \\n\",\n",
              "  \"The Dominican Republic brims with all-inclusive resorts. Much of St Barts is about megayachts and swanky restaurants. Families and springbreakers flock to the Bahamas in droves. Nevis exudes an off-the-beaten-path allure (and celebs love it). For a sun-splashed getaway with a little bit of everything that makes a Caribbean vacation so enticing — adventure, relaxation, sea-view accommodations, breathtaking shores, and flavorful cuisine — plus a whole lot of luxury, you really can't beat Anguilla in the Lesser Antilles. \\n With beautiful beaches and gorgeous sunsets, it's one of the most picturesque islands in the region. “What makes it so special is, without a doubt, the people. Visitors will encounter warm, humble, and genuine hospitality throughout the island,” Colleen Harrigan-Walsh, an Anguillian native and the sales manager at the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Anguilla, told Travel + Leisure. Anguilla also has some truly next-level resorts with service, amenities, and a romantic ambiance that rivals anywhere. \\n Not surprisingly, it’s a top destination for honeymoons and babymoons. More than just a setting to let sparks fly, this Caribbean gem is also a great place to bring kids thanks to properties with kids clubs, sparkling swimming pools, and direct ocean access. Foodies rave about the standout culinary scene with seafood — especially local crayfish — as the star. \\n Ready to dip your toes in the warm ocean waters, frolic on the white sand, and sip fresh-cracked coconuts? Before jetting off to paradise, scroll on for expert guidance on everything you need to know to plan an unforgettable trip to Anguilla. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n It’s no secret that Malliouhana knows a thing or two about luxury. This locally operated beachfront icon makes glamour look effortless with decor so chic and colorful it’s an instant mood boost. Couples with gracious hospitality and an utterly intoxicating atmosphere, it's also a place that’s tailor-made for romance — whether you’re blissing out on a striped lounge by the tumbling oceanfront infinity pool, lazing in a palm-shaded hammock, or doing date night at Celeste. \\n The rebranded Four Seasons Resort and Residences Anguilla (formerly the Viceroy Anguilla) shows off a more modern aesthetic and kid-friendly setup than many of the luxury properties on the island. That certainly doesn’t mean it’s anything less than an ideal spot to unwind. Thoughtful service, three pools, sprawling suites and villas, and activities ranging from kayaking to volleyball ensure a family vacation full of ease and excitement where you won’t have to lift a finger. \\n Generations of discovering and loyal travelers remember Cap Juluca as the Anguillan resort that started it all. Luxury continues to hit new levels at this beloved Belmond property. Besides an immaculate setting on Maundays Bay and white-glove service, guests beam at the white-washed architecture, superb restaurants, and spa treatments. Suites aren’t just for snoozing, but rather full-blown sanctuaries with king-sized beds, double tubs, and private pools just steps away from the waves. \\n Couples seeking relaxation and romance will be in total ecstasy at the Quintessence Hotel, an adults-only Relais & Chateaux retreat overlooking the shores of idyllic Long Bay. Framed by lush tropical gardens, this intimate Relais & Châteaux property combines the best parts of a grand mansion and a luxury beachfront resort. There are nine sophisticated villas and suites — all of which come with 24/7 butler service — plus an infinity pool, spa, tennis courts, a celebrated French restaurant with an impressive wine cellar, and a well-curated art gallery. \\n A great option for families, newcomer Aurora Anguilla Resort & Golf Club spans over 300 acres of tropical gardens and a beachfront that looks photoshopped. The 178-suite property also boasts an array of impressive facilities sure to delight travelers of all ages — including sparkling pools, multiple restaurants, a 27,000-square-foot spa, a Greg Norman-designed golf course, and a forthcoming waterpark — in addition to pickleball clinics, socceramma games, and lobster BBQs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Beaches\\n\\n You’d be hard-pressed to find a prettier beach on the island of Anguilla than Rendezvous Bay or one with a better view of St. Martin. A stunning destination for seaside strolls, swimming, and snapping photos, the palm-fringed crescent of snow-white sand lapped by aqua tides looks like the product of a really good Instagram filter — but we assure you, it’s all-natural. \\n Repeatedly ranked among the top beaches in the world and one of the most beloved spots to soak up some sun in Anguilla, Meads Bay holds its own against any other sandy stretch of shoreline in the Caribbean. “Beyond being a pristine place to lay out, it’s dotted with superb restaurants and resorts,” notes Harrigan-Walsh. \\n A secluded cove in northwest Anguilla that’s only reachable by boat, Little Bay is the definition of a hidden and halcyon gem. The remote location definitely helps combat the crowds, guaranteeing you’ll only have to share the aquamarine ocean and white sand with a handful of other sun worshippers and snorkeling enthusiasts. \\n Calm waters, coral gardens, and abundant marine life add up to Shoal Bay East topping the list of the best spots in all of Anguilla for snorkeling (and that’s really saying something). And because it’s always lovely to relax after searching for vibrant tropical fish, umbrellas and lounge chairs are available for rent. \\n For even more peace, quiet, and tropical scenery, it’s worth booking a boat excursion to Sandy Island, a sliver of white sand surrounded by turquoise water. Daytrippers can catch some rays, go snorkeling along the pristine reef, and sip rum punch at the one brightly colored restaurant. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Archaeology might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of Anguilla, but maybe it should be (or, at least, in the top five). Big Spring Cave is a prehistoric Amerindian ceremonial site that dates back to 600 A.D. and showcases many anthropomorphic petroglyphs alongside freshwater springs. \\n Another site with a lot of Pre-Columbian historical significance, Fountain Cavern preserves a fascinating array of ancient artifacts from the indigenous Amerindians, who lived on Anguilla some 1,500 years ago, including petroglyphs etched into the bedrock and carved stalagmites. \\n Scrub Island is small, uninhabited, and steeped in myth. Despite being located not far from the eastern tip of Anguilla, it has a windswept, uncharted appeal with wild goats roaming free and near-empty beaches. Legends swirl around the abandoned hotel, wreckage of a smuggling plane, and notorious Deadman's Bay, making for a mystical and memorable day trip. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Anguilla Restaurants\\n\\n Perched on Rendezvous Bay, the Sunshine Shack — locally referred to as “Garvey’s” according to Harrigan-Walsh — is everyone’s favorite, colorful good-time-haunt for fresh food and great vibes. Locals and tourists pack the open-air tables to dig into plates of grilled chicken, ribs, snapper, and lobster and toss back a cold beer or rum punch while watching the flags flap in the breeze and gazing at the waves lapping the sand. \\n Set on photogenic Meads Bay, Blanchards is renowned as one of the best restaurants on the island. The menu highlights local ingredients with plenty of delicious seafood as well as vegetarian and vegan options, the service is always stellar, and the choice to dine in the open-air dining room, at the bar, or outside on the leafy patio keeps things delightfully laid-back. \\n A fantastic spot for lunch or dinner, Jacala treats diners to artfully plated seafood dishes (the lobster risotto, conch ceviche salad, and red snapper get rave reviews) as well as a beautiful beachfront position and warm hospitality. Oh, and in case you need another reason to check it out, Martha Steward is a fan. \\n Sharky's Restaurant has the rare distinction of being adored by residents and out-of-towners alike. It’s also one of the few places in Anguilla that’s not on the beach — but don’t let that be a deterrent. The outdoor patio and live Caribbean music give it a lively feel. And once you try the stir-fried lobster, it’s all you’ll dream about until the next visit. \\n Some of the best (and no that doesn’t necessarily translate to fanciest) bars and restaurants are at high-end hotels, so it should come as no surprise that The Cap Shack calls Cap Juluca home. It’s a breezy beachside eatery but done the Belmond way. That means attentive service, fabulous views of Maundays Bay, and taste bud-tantalizing food — the tuna poke bowl and lobster roll are not to be missed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n Anguilla has great beach weather year-round, but it's especially faultless in the winter and early spring. Prices and demand are highest during this time (especially on holiday weekends) with many people attempting to trade ice and snow for blue skies, sunshine, and consistent temps in the low 80s. Travelers can score good deals from May to August because it marks the start of hurricane season, though the chance of a big storm remains low. \\n If you're really trying to pinch pennies (though to be clear, Anguilla is never what we'd call cheap), it may be tempting to take advantage of the reduced rates and lack of crowds in September, October, and early November. Just keep in mind that many businesses will be closed and inclement weather may impact your travel plans. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Most travelers fly into Princess Juliana International Airport (SXM) on Sint Maarten, which welcomes nonstop flights from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Miami International Airport (MIA), and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). They then hop on the ferry or a private vessel over to Anguilla. There’s also a 10-minute flight courtesy of Anguilla Air Services that links to the two islands. \\n Alternatively, if you’d rather skip the boat and small aircraft, and don’t mind a stopover in the Magic City, Envoy Air, the largest regional carrier for American Airlines, operates a direct route between Miami International Airport (MIA) and Anguilla-Clayton J. Lloyd Airport (AXA). Tradewind provides scheduled service between Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport (SJU) and Anguilla-Clayton J. Lloyd Airport (AXA) seasonally, from December to early April. \\n The most streamlined option comes by way of Aurora Anguilla Resort & Golf Club, which recently launched charter flights exclusively for guests. These routes depart from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) and zip straight to Anguilla. On the way back, it’s a quick stop in San Juan to clear customs before returning stateside. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Because Anguilla doesn’t have public transport, visitors typically get around by taxi or rental car. You’ll also see sunglass-wearing vacationers driving Mokes, the top-down, fun-in-the-sun British rides that are all the rage in the Caribbean. \\n\",\n",
              "  'Arguably no U.S. mountain town is as synonymous with ski culture as Aspen. It\\'s got glitz and glamour — think: Moncler jackets and pop-up bars from New York brands — and a cadre of die-hard skiers who practically live on the slopes. The worlds collide during après-ski, when unbuckled ski boots, cold beer, and tall ski tales reign supreme. It\\'s a tradition that started over 75 years ago, when the ski area first opened, and it remains strong today. \\n But while Aspen will always be first and foremost a ski destination, the party doesn\\'t stop when the snow melts. Hiking and biking trails replace ski runs and the snow-dusted mountains pop against the couleurs du saison — bright green in the spring and yellow-orange in the fall. And, if Aspen\\'s natural beauty and outdoor offerings don\\'t interest you, there\\'s still plenty to do — the mountain town is home to plenty of high-end boutiques and a food and art scene that\\'s on par with the nation\\'s largest cities. \\n So, slather on some sunscreen — the sun shines year-round in Colorado — and head to the hills of Aspen, a veritable playground for anyone lucky enough to visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Mountain Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n If you\\'re drawn to Aspen for the skiing, book your trip in February or March when the snow base is reliable, fresh flakes tend to fall, and the weather begins to warm. If you\\'re all about food, there\\'s no better time to visit than during the Food & Wine Classic, which typically takes over the town in mid-June. For a quieter visit, come during the spring or fall shoulder seasons, when the crowds dissipate and the vibe is more relaxed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Elevation: 7,908-feet \\n Ski Areas: Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk, Snowmass \\n Distance From Denver: less than four hours by car \\n Airport: Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (ASE) \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Buses: Free shuttle buses make stops throughout town and at the base of the town\\'s four ski areas \\n Taxis: High Mountain Taxi, Downtowner (Aspen\\'s Uber-style taxi service) \\n Car service: Aspen Star Limo, Aspen Transportation Co. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The St. Regis Aspen Resort\\n\\n Address: 315 E.

Durant Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-4600Website \\n If you\\'re looking for a high-end stay at a ski-in, ski-out property, look no further. This iconic Aspen hotel is the only luxury ski-in, ski-out property in town — and its reputation is well-deserved. In the rooms, you\\'ll find marble bathrooms, balconies, and suites with steam showers and fireplaces. And when it\\'s time to leave your cozy Aspen home, it\\'s just a few steps to the lifts of Aspen Mountain and the Silver Queen Gondola. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Limelight Hotel\\n\\n Address: 355 S. Monarch St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-3025Website \\n If you visited Aspen in the good ol\\' days, you probably remember the storied Limelight Lodge (formerly a bar called The Limelight). The hotel remains today, although as you might expect, it\\'s undergone a hefty facelift, evolving into a hip, youthful hotel with sister properties in Ketchum, Idaho and the neighboring town of Snowmass. Included in your stay at this truly iconic hotel are loaner bikes, ski lockers, and a ski shuttle to make the four-block walk to the lifts that much easier. \\n \\n\\nHeading: W Aspen\\n\\n Address: 550 S. Spring St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 431-0800Website \\n It\\'s a breezy two-minute walk to the base of Aspen Mountain ski area from W Aspen, but even if you never set foot (or ski boot) on the mountain, you\\'ll enjoy 360-degree views from your perch in this sophisticated hotel. Hotel perks include access to the WET Deck, an outdoor patio with a pool, hot tub, fire pits, and mountain views. For a day of shopping, reserve the property\\'s house BMW and cruise around in style. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hotel Jerome, Auberge Resorts Collection\\n\\n Address: 330 E. Main St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-1000Website \\n This Main Street property is found in a distinct redbrick building that\\'s been an Aspen landmark since 1889.

The hotel remains a go-to for visitors thanks to its luxurious rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows and buzzy location in the heart of town. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Ajax Tavern (French/American)\\n\\n Address: 685 E. Durant Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-6334Website \\n When it comes to après it\\'s hard to top Ajax Tavern, which sits at the base of Aspen Mountain ski area and has a wonderful sun-drenched patio that will entice you to put up your ski legs and order a cocktail. The casual, yet quality menu makes sticking around for dinner a no brainer — especially if you\\'re craving truffle fries and a wagyu double cheeseburger. Indoor and outdoor seating is available, and reservations are recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Jing (Asian Fusion)\\n\\n Address: 413 E. Main St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-9988Website \\n Just because you\\'re in the mountains doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t get your sushi fix. At this cozy Asian-fusion restaurant you\\'ll have access to a full raw bar and sushi menu along with dim sum, small plates, and steaks. (We recommend the French onion soup dumplings.) Indoor and outdoor seating is available, weather dependent, and reservations are recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ellina (Italian)\\n\\n Address: 430 E. Hyman Ave. (downstairs), Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-2976Website \\n Ellina, which has been an Aspen mainstay since 2009, is a must for pasta lovers craving a romantic night out on the town. The menu of housemade pasta pairs perfectly with a handful of meat and fish-driven entrees and a list of starters that will leave your mouth watering (try the artichoke heart bruschetta). Seating is indoors and reservations are recommended during the height of summer and winter season. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Wild Fig (French)\\n\\n Address: 315 E. Hyman Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-5160Website \\n If you\\'re craving a cozy evening at a French brasserie, look no further.

Hopkins Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-1007Website \\n Sometimes simplicity is where it\\'s at — and while the menu at the White House Tavern is simple (think: French dip, kale salad, and a burger), every menu item is elevated to make the meal a memorable one. The restaurant is housed in a tiny 19th-century miner\\'s cottage, so seating — both indoor and outdoor — is limited, and they don\\'t accept reservations. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Catch Steak (Steakhouse)\\n\\n Address: 515 E Hopkins Ave, Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 452-8080Website \\n Just as buzzy as the New York City original but bringing its own Colorado flair, Catch Steak is the place to flaunt the high-end western wear you just bought at Kemo Sabe over a cold brew negroni or smoked cocktail that actually comes shrouded in smoke. Start with oysters or sushi, but save room for the main event: the meat. Opt for Japanese wagyu cooked tableside or large cuts like a 40-oz. tomahawk or 32-oz. prime porterhouse for sharing. Sit outside by the fire with views of Aspen Mountain, or grab a booth or a seat at the bar indoors if you can. Reservations are recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Duemani (Mediterranean/Seafood)\\n\\n Address: 216 S Monarch St, Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-2555Website \\n From the team behind Aspen\\'s top pizza spot, Acquolina, Duemani serves quality seafood and meats prepared with Mediterranean flavor alongside an extensive wine list.

Durant Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-1220Website \\n Here\\'s a secret: You don\\'t have to ski to scale Aspen Mountain resort and enjoy the view — all you have to do is hop on the Silver Queen Gondola.

Durant Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-1220Website \\n We\\'d be remiss not to include the ski resort on this list since skiing is what put Aspen on the map in the first place. Arguably the best thing about skiing Aspen Snowmass is that one lift ticket gives you access to four separate mountains — Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk, and Snowmass. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Aspen Art Museum\\n\\n Address: 637 E. Hyman Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-8050Website \\n Aspen is a town of less than 10,000 people, but because it draws visitors from all over the world, it has amenities most small towns could only dream of. Enter, the Aspen Art Museum, a contemporary museum with rotating exhibitions that feature works of art by international artists (hello, Andy Warhol) as well as local talent. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Food & Wine Classic in Aspen\\n\\n Website \\n Food.

Cooper Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-7576Website \\n Gorsuch is so synonymous with high-end ski fashion that they have three locations in Aspen and one in Snowmass. This is where luxury travelers shop to look their best both on and off the mountain — you\\'ll find top-of-the-line ski equipment, beautiful clothing, and chic home furnishings. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Kemo Sabe Aspen\\n\\n Address: 217 S. Galena St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-7878Website \\n Wanna look like you belong in the Wild West?

Cooper Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-1681Website \\n The tagline at Pitkin County Dry Goods is \"Aspen\\'s Original Clothing Store,\" which makes sense when you learn that the shop opened in 1969 and still outfits Aspenites today.

Main St., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-5336Website \\n Explore Booksellers is located in an unbelievably quaint Victorian house on Main Street, but the real magic is found inside, among the historic home\\'s nooks and crannies. For around 50 years the bookshop has been supplying visitors and locals with books that transport you out of the Roaring Fork Valley and into another world. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Little Bird\\n\\n Address: 525 E. Cooper Ave., Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 920-3830Website \\n The Little Bird may be a consignment shop, but we\\'d argue it\\'s unlike any resale shop you\\'ve ever been to. The knowledgeable staff inspect every item, curating a selection of luxury and designer clothing that\\'s in tip-top shape. That means you can get your Chanel, Hermes, and Valentino for a fraction of what it originally cost. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Souchi\\n\\n Address: 205 S, Mill St., #231A, Aspen, CO 81611Phone: (970) 925-2580Website \\n Nothing says \"luxe Aspen ski trip\" like a cozy cashmere sweater. And for the best cashmere — think pieces that are hand-loomed locally — you\\'ll want to head to Souchi, a women\\'s boutique that specializes in comfy cashmere pieces. In addition to cashmere, the shop sells designer clothing, accessories, and shoes. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Aspen is a small town in every sense; it\\'s physically only four square miles. That being said, you\\'ll still find a few distinct neighborhoods within the city limits: \\n Central Core: This is the true heart of Aspen — the gondola, restaurants, boutiques, and ski lifts are never more than a few blocks away, making getting around on foot (or ski boot) a breeze. The Central Core community is the go-to spot for visitors to Aspen and includes a mix of both modern and historic buildings. \\n East Aspen: East Aspen has a more laid-back feel than the \"downtown\" Central Core. Here, the vibe is residential and family friendly, with mountain views as far as the eye can see. \\n Smuggler: To the far east of Aspen, nestled at the base of Smuggler Mountain, is the Smuggler neighborhood. The views of Aspen Mountain ski area are particularly impressive from here. \\n West End: The West End butts up against the Central Core, offering travelers a sense of calm without compromising access to the town\\'s amenities. In this mellow neighborhood, you\\'ll find a pristine blend of historic houses, canopied streets, and a generally slower pace. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring: With temperatures that range from the low 20s to the low 60s, spring in Aspen is all about waiting for the thaw. Late season snow gives way to warmer days around April, as the first blooms of the year appear. \\n Summer: The temperature can still be as low as the mid-30s in the summer (especially in the earlier months), but in general, daytime summer temperatures make it into the 70s. \\n Fall: In the fall, the weather begins to make its way back into the low 30s, prompting the area\\'s famous Aspen trees to turn wonderful shades of gold before the cold weather arrives. \\n Winter: It can be chilly in the winter, with below-zero mornings, but the midday thaw can also result in ski days in the 30s and 40s. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Aspen Snowmass: The hub for all four of the ski area\\'s mountains.

              "  'There are so many new and exciting things to see in Auckland now that travelers can once again visit New Zealand. Commercial Bay is a relatively new addition to the city, which has revolutionized the CBD\\'s retail and hospitality scene. There\\'s also the reinvigorated Viaduct Harbor, with several new luxury hotel offerings, and the Britomart precinct – an exquisite industrial transformation that has been two decades in the making. \\n Regardless of these world-class developments, most of Auckland\\'s charm lies in its natural beauty, with pristine beaches, verdant volcanic peaks, and twin harbors facing the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea. \\n International travelers often view Auckland as a stopover on the way to Queenstown or The Bay of Islands, but there are many reasons to make it a destination on any New Zealand itinerary and spend at least a few days experiencing all of the magical things it has to offer. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n New Zealand Standard Time (NZST). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The best time to go is during New Zealand\\'s summer, ideally between December and the beginning of March. A big part of New Zealand\\'s appeal is its natural beauty, and all of the outdoor activities around the city are definitely best experienced when it\\'s warm and sunny. \\n Summertime also brings a lot of music and arts festivals, and every January, Auckland\\'s version of Wimbledon takes place in the city at the ASB Classic tennis tournament. Regardless of the season, New Zealand weather can change in a pinch, so make sure you pack all the essentials to be prepared for any situation. \\n Find flights \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Auckland is New Zealand\\'s largest city, where urban life and natural splendor intersect. You can easily walk around the CBD, but the best way to properly explore the city is by car, as the key suburbs are quite spread out and public transport can be indirect and time-consuming. It\\'s definitely worth visiting Newmarket, Ponsonby, Parnell, and Takapuna over on the North Shore while you\\'re there – there are some beautiful beaches and fantastic cafes and boutiques. \\n Locals are friendly and always willing to provide directions. It\\'s also a safe place with a very low crime rate, which is another reason why it\\'s often on listed as one of the world\\'s most livable cities. \\n Tipping is not the norm in New Zealand, though some travelers opt to add gratuity when dining out. \\n Currency: NZD (check the current exchange rate). \\n Language: English \\n Calling Code: +64 \\n Capital City: Wellington \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The train system in Auckland is not quite as extensive as what you would find in other metropolitan cities, but there are four main lines that connect to the Britomart Train Station. It\\'s a relatively new development, so everything is clean and modern. \\n Ferries: Fullers and Sealink both operate from downtown Auckland and provide routes to Devonport, Waiheke Island, Rangitoto, Hobsonville Point, and Half Moon Bay. It\\'s a scenic way to travel around the city. \\n Taxis: Corporate Cabs and Co-op Taxis are the main driver services in Auckland. Both are clean and reliable with friendly drivers. It should cost under $75 from the airport to the CBD, regardless of the traffic. \\n Buses: CityLink buses run regularly and have stops all around Auckland. This map illustrates the main routes. There are also bus services that cater to wider suburban areas but beware of hopping on during rush-hour as the motorways can get very congested. \\n Car apps: Uber and Ola are the main car apps used in Auckland, both with comparable pricing. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: 99 Halsey Street, Auckland, 1010, New ZealandPhone: +64 9 366 1234Book Now \\n Occupying a prime waterfront position in Wynyard Quarter, Park Hyatt is Auckland\\'s glossiest new luxury hotel, perfectly appointed for the international jet set.

              "  'The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an archipelago stretched out across 500 miles of the Atlantic Ocean. With turquoise waters, warm, salty breezes, and plenty of opportunities to mingle with fun-loving locals, it’s a well-favored Caribbean island destination — perhaps especially for those living along the eastern seaboard, which is connected to the Bahamas via abundant direct flights. Even if you are coming from farther away, this island chain is worth the journey. \\n “We have always been known for our beautiful beaches and weather; I\\'m glad that more travelers want to experience something even more valuable than that — the Bahamian people,” Kya Nguyen told Travel + Leisure. Nguyen is a local tour guide who can trace her family’s island lineage back several generations. In fact, her last name has been linked to Blackbeard’s crew. \\n “People also love and appreciate our nature and wildlife. Guests always remark on the curly tailed lizards, and my young pineapples are a favorite photo opp,” Nguyen added. Another sight Nguyen says to prioritize? \"Junkanoo, a uniquely Bahamian street parade celebrating music, dance, and freedom. There are parades and events throughout the islands that hold a similar name — Jonkonnu in Jamaica, John Canoe in Belize. But there\\'s only one Bahamian Junkanoo experience, and it\\'s on Bay Street [in Nassau].” \\n From famed spots like Pink Sand Beach to world-class, family-friendly accommodations at Atlantis on Paradise Island, every inch of the Bahamas is an inch to explore. Here’s everything you need to know to plan a trip to the Bahamas. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Atlantis is one of the most popular resorts in the Bahamas — Prince William and Kate Middleton even spent the night here during their tour of the Caribbean. There are five different hotels on the massive property, so guests can choose the vibe that\\'s right for them. \\n Baha Mar on the island of New Providence is one of the beloved (and convenient) resort options for those flying into Nassau, as it\\'s a short drive from the airport. The 1,000-acre luxury resort is home to three different luxury hotels, plus 15 acres of private beachfront for guests to enjoy, and a new waterpark. Baha Mar also has satellite properties on other islands, including Bimini and Harbour Island. \\n T+L readers voted Kamalame Cay one of their favorite hotels in the 2022 World’s Best Awards, likely thanks to the property\\'s sense of solitude. One reader noted that the 96-acre resort isn’t exactly easy to get to, but relaxing in a beachfront villa without another soul in sight makes the trek worthwhile. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n You will surely spend some time at the beach if you\\'ve come to the Bahamas. Luckily, all of the Bahamian islands have beautiful beaches to choose from. If we had to suggest a specific one, it would be the highly photogenic Pink Sand Beach on Harbour Island. This three-mile stretch of soft, pink sand — which gets its color from seashells and microscopic organisms called foraminifera — is a place to go for total relaxation. Bring a book, or just plan on spending your time staring at your gorgeous surroundings in total awe. \\n Get out and experience the azure waters surrounding the Bahamas by booking a day trip on a boat, or chartering a private vessel with a captain who will happily lead you on a dive or snorkel adventure. Deep-sea fishing excursions are also available via chartered boat. \\n You don\\'t have to be an overnight guest to experience the fun that Atlantis resort has to offer. All you need to do is purchase a day pass, and you\\'ll have access to the thrilling 141-acre Aquaventure water park, which includes pools, beaches, a rapid river, and waterslides. If that\\'s not enough, try your luck in the casino, play a round of golf, or have a meal at one of multiple on-site restaurants. \\n Lucayan National Park on Grand Bahama Island is another must-see spot. Here, visitors can kayak through mangroves or simply go for a stroll, spotting local flora and fauna. \\n Read More: 21 Best Things to Do in The Bahamas — Snorkeling, Island Hopping, and Rum Sipping Included \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n For a five-star dining experience, book a table at Graycliff, an upscale restaurant set in an 18th-century mansion on West Hill Street in Nassau. Expect conch soup and lobster, plus plenty of freshly caught fish. \\n For a more low-key dining experience, head to Anchor Bay in Governor\\'s Harbour for its beloved fish fry. The event is held every Friday and includes plates of fried fish and other local delicacies. \\n Travelers will have one more meal to dress up for at Dune, located at The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort. With a menu by chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, expect delicious offerings like yellowfin tartare, shrimp satay, and roasted grouper with lime chili sauce. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Times to Visit\\n\\n Peak season lasts from mid-December to mid-April, when the weather is at its most glorious. This is also when crowds descend on the islands, so you\\'ll have to contend with higher prices and other tourists. \\n It never gets much colder than 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the Bahamas, so there\\'s not really a \"bad\" time to visit. Do keep in mind that the Atlantic hurricane season stretches from June to November, though, which is worth considering when you\\'re booking your trip. \\n The summer months are also rainy, but there will be fewer visitors and more affordable rates. Tourist numbers dip lowest in September and October, so plan a trip during these months if you want to visit the Bahamas when crowds are at their thinnest. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit The Bahamas for Fewer Crowds, Lower Prices, and More \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Plenty of travelers fly into the Caribbean — there are 20 international airports across the islands, with regularly scheduled flights from around the world. Nassau is the most connected destination, while getting to the Out Islands can be a bit more complicated (though totally worth it). Your flight to the Out Islands will probably connect via Nassau. Private charters are a popular option, too. \\n Cruises might be the most common way to get to the Bahamas. Most cruise lines stop in the Bahamas along their Caribbean routes, and some brands even have private islands in the archipelago, including Disney Cruise Line (Castaway Cay); Carnival Cruise Line (Half Moon Cay); Norwegian Cruise Line (Great Stirrup Cay); Princess Cruises (Princess Cays); MSC Cruises (Ocean Cay — MSC Marine Reserve); and Royal Caribbean International (Perfect Day at CocoCay). Virgin Voyages has a private destination on Bimini called the Beach Club at Bimini, and Jimmy Buffett\\'s Margaritaville brand has a Margaritaville at Sea cruise ship that sails from the Port of Palm Beach to Grand Bahama Island on a regular basis. \\n \\n\\nHeading: What Islands to Visit\\n\\n There are more than 700 islands in the Bahamas, and while visiting them all is a lofty goal, it\\'s reasonable to see a few during one trip. “Visit one of the 30 other inhabited islands outside of Nassau,\" Nguyen says. \"If you’ve only ever been to Nassau, you haven’t seen all the Bahamas has for you.” \\n Here are a few islands to consider for your itinerary. \\n Grand Bahama: A visit to Grand Bahama means getting to experience the archipelago\\'s best outdoor adventures. Snorkeling and diving guides lead aquatic adventures here, and land lovers can relax on famed beaches like Lucaya Beach and Gold Rock Beach. Grand Bahama is also home to Lucayan National Park, which means there is plenty of wildlife spotting to do, too. \\n Harbour Island: Those looking for an enchanting and colorful experience need not look further than Harbour Island. This is where visitors will find Insta-famous, pastel-colored homes shaded by palm trees. There are gorgeous beaches here, too, Pink Sand Beach is certainly the most famous. \\n Exumas: Another Insta-famous destination, Exumas is where you\\'ll find friendly pigs swimming in the sea, and they\\'re eager for you to come and say hello. If you\\'re sticking around on this island, dig your umbrella into the sand at Coco Plum Beach. \\n New Providence Island: You can\\'t really skip New Providence, as it’s home to Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas and the most common gateway to the islands. Urban hustle and bustle meets serene island escapism in this city, and in all the right ways. Leave time to explore the museums and beaches, and spend a night on the town to feel the city\\'s energy after dark. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Getting Around\\n\\n Rental car: If you plan to stay on one island for a while, book a rental car so you can get around with ease. Options are abundant at the airport in Nassau, including known brands like Avis, Hertz, and Budget. See all the options here. \\n Taxi: Taxi services will get you from point A to point B, and rates are fixed by the government, so it\\'s easy to estimate your fare. Ride-shares like Uber and Lyft do not operate on the island. But, if you want to schedule a ride, try the local Let’s Go Bahama app. \\n Intra-island flights: There are both scheduled intra-island flights and chartered flights available throughout the Bahamas. Bahamasair offers routes between Treasure Cay and Marsh Harbor in Abacos, and Nassau to Great Exuma. Other airline options for getting around the islands include Flamingo Air and Western Air. See all flight options here. \\n Ferry: There are several ferry and water taxi services available throughout the Bahamas to transport guests from one island to another. For example, Green Turtle Ferry services the Abaco Islands, with scheduled service between Green Turtle Cay, New Plymouth, and Treasure Cay on Great Abaco, while Bahamas Ferries offers connections between Long Island and Georgetown, Exuma, or Nassau. See all ferry options here. \\n',\n",
              "  'Matteo Colombo/Getty Images \\n As magical destinations go, Bali is definitely up there. There are the awe-inspiring temples in the tens of thousands — literally — and near-daily ceremonies: vivid, multi-sensory, and loud, accompanied by chanting and clanging gamelan. Add to that endless beaches trimmed in aquamarine surf, pulsing with relentlessly curling waves topped with dancing surfers. There are miles and miles of verdant rice paddies, terraced so immaculately they\\'ve become iconic. And don\\'t forget canang sari, the prolific flower-laden offerings blessed and placed seemingly everywhere daily on the so-called \"Island of Gods.\" \\n \"From its pristine beaches to lush landscapes, cultural treasures, and thrilling adventures, Bali will resonate with every traveler,\" Giordano Faggioli, the general manager of Ayana Estate, told Travel + Leisure. \"Guests can seek relaxation, exploration, spiritual rejuvenation, or adrenaline-pumping pursuits that harmoniously offer an unforgettable experience.\" \\n Bali has an energy about it that acts as a siren song to woo-woo wellness practitioners, design buffs, and carousing Gen Z-ers in equal numbers, along with stoked surfers, spiritual pilgrims, yogis, beach lovers, plus plenty of celebrities and influencers to boot. And the most fulfilling and thrilling Bali holidays include a few locations, so don\\'t stress about picking just one vibe or scene — it\\'s best to combine a few, or two if you\\'re short on time. \\n \"Guests can tailor their Bali experience based on personal preferences,\" Faggioli said. \"My suggestion is to scale the heights of Mount Batur to witness a captivating sunrise over the island’s volcanic terrain. Immerse in the local community and Balinese everyday life at Sukowati market.\"Enjoy island time and the locals who are overwhelmingly generous, sweet, and genuine. All factors considered, it\\'s nearly impossible not to leave Bali feeling far better — happier, healthier, and definitely more tan — than when you landed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels & Resorts\\n\\n It\\'s obvious you\\'re somewhere special right upon arrival at this John Heah—designed resort. The standalone villas (each with a private pool) and suites have slept everyone from the Obamas to Julia Roberts. River rafting, cycling, and other adventurous cultural tours are on offer, but the resort environment — with its pools, flavorful food, and entertainment — is so alluring it\\'s tempting to just relax, too. \\n As resort concepts go, Capella Ubud, voted one of the best resorts in Indonesia in 2022 by T+L readers, is truly one-of-a-kind. Its 22 one-bedroom tented and batik-draped retreats, hand-painted Mads Lange restaurant, and even saltwater pool all float over the jungle floor — not one tree was cut as the whimsical Bill Bensley creations were constructed. \\n An artisanal theme pervades this brick-clad Brutalist boutique hotel that manages to be a quiet respite in the heart of lively Seminyak. It all celebrates Indonesia\\'s rich traditions of craft through a midcentury-esque lens. Tear yourself away from the long turquoise pool to hit the beach, just a few minutes away, or some of the hundreds of shops and restaurants within walking distance. \\n This airy modern beachfront resort occupies prime real estate in Canggu, easy walking—or scooting—distance to all the town\\'s hot spots. Hopeful surfers should book lessons with the consummate professionals at Tropicsurf onsite, while the wellness-minded have their choice of Pilates, yoga, a Jungle Sports studio, and a comprehensive spa. \\n If paradisiacal views are what you crave, Uluwatu Surf Villas has you covered. The legendary surfers\\' resort perched above those famously large waves (there\\'s a set of private steps down) offers traditionally Balinese-designed thatched-roof cliff-front villas as well as a collection of newer architectural masterpieces, each one with its own unique tropical modern vibe. \\n Feel like you\\'re the only one in Bali with a stay at Ayana Villas, a resort made up of 78 private villas, each with its own plunge pools. Ocean views, flowering gardens, and utter romance abound at this chic resort, making it an ideal spot for honeymooners to come to bask in that new love glow. \\n Read More: T+L Readers\\' 5 Favorite Resorts in Indonesia of 2023 \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n There\\'s no question about the iconic status of Tegallalang, the flawless and highly photogenic rice terraces curving around hillsides and irrigated by the subak system, which has UNESCO status. As good as that hot spot is, the more intimate way to experience the ubiquitous emerald paddies is by bicycle, which many Ubud hotels and tour companies offer led by local guides. \\n Bali\\'s reputation as a surf destination is well earned, thanks to its rich assortment of not only professional-grade waves (see the aquamarine behemoths rolling in like corduroy in Keramas and Uluwatu, where Kelly Slater surfs) but also beginner-level breaks like Baby Padang at Padang Padang Beach and Batu Bolong in Canggu. There are fantastic surf camps and instructors across the island. \\n Bali\\'s transcendent charm is rooted in its tens of thousands of Hindu temples, and there are many worth visiting for a dose of impressively ornate architecture and mystical ambiance. Some of the most iconic on the island are Pura Tirta Empul (pura means \"temple\"), where you can bathe and bless yourself in holy spring waters spouting from carved stone; Pura Besakih, the largest and holiest of them all; and Pura Luhur Uluwatu, the clifftop sea temple where each sunset draws tourists for flashy yet authentic kecak (fire) dances. \\n Ubud is associated with all things spiritual, and high vibe, and its multitude of yoga studios and movement centers are evidence. Practitioners can find more than 100 classes per week at The Yoga Barn, an epicenter of yin, vinyasa, Hatha, and kundalini, plus meditation, sound healing, and ecstatic dance. \\n Read More: The 22 Best Things to Do in Bali, according to Travel + Leisure. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n The founders of this celebrated ceramic design studio are an Italian expat couple, but their ultra-skilled team of some 100 craftsmen are overwhelmingly Balinese. It\\'s impossible to leave the showroom empty-handed, thanks to its proliferation of glamorous handmade dishes and decor. \\n This petite shop packs a major punch with tightly curated and oftentimes collaborative goods made by Balinese artisans, think placemats, eye-catching brass cutlery, and a plant-dyed shibori clothing collection. Beautiful gifts — for yourself and also loved ones back home—include signature Canaan candles, artisanal fans from Yogyakarta, and Cisco & the Sun\\'s wabi sabi–inspired ceramics. \\n Ethereal, elegant, and earthy womenswear can be found at this Canggu boutique. The eponymous label began on Bali in 2005 and marries an effortless French sensibility with a cool-girl palette ideal for island holidays. \\n You don\\'t need to be a pro in the waves to embark on a spree at this beloved surf shop. A reclaimed joglo house holds dozens of slick, technicolor surfboards — finely crafted by sought-after shapers — along with Drifter\\'s own brand of art-emblazoned tees, international bikini collections, original artwork, boho jewelry, ocean-themed books, and far more. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n With a name meaning \"tribe\" in Bahasa Indonesia, Kaum is a concept born of its culinary team\\'s deep exploration of Indonesia\\'s super diverse archipelago and its tribes\\' cooking and catching methods (fishing and spear hunting to name a few adventures). A sampling of fiery sambals is a great way to start feasting on rich regional dishes made of specialty ingredients sourced as locally as possible. \\n It\\'s not too extreme an exaggeration to call Ubud a mecca for vegans, and this plant-, root- and shoot-slinging destination is like the high temple in the lush jungle. Zest, the chic, plant-powered restaurant appropriately hugs a living frangipani tree and offers up colorful, organic fare from jackfruit steaks to pizzas and cassava fettuccini alongside a lively community and creative, island-grown cocktails and tonics. \\n Casually elegant and tucked away like a well-kept secret amid Ubud\\'s busy streets, this eatery is a perfect blend of warung (a basic Indonesian cafe or small restaurant) and fine dining restaurant. Sit near one of many open windows for views of a classic Balinese neighborhood while sipping vibrant cocktails (think Carrot Mai Tais and Butterfly Pea Martinis). \\n Intimate dinners at Sokasi — the curvaceous bamboo pavilion perched above the rushing Ayung River at the Four Seasons in Sayan — are all about preserving the island\\'s time-intensive culinary heritage. Arrive early for a peek at the pig roasting over a coconut wood fire before tucking into rich, forgotten recipes featuring flavors like wild ginger and klengis (an extract from hand-making coconut oil). \\n Tapas in Indonesia sounds random but dreamed up and prepared with quality produce and products sourced from the archipelago by chef Kevin Cherkas (whose CV includes several Michelin three-star restaurants), it\\'s flawless. The nine-course tasting menu at Cuca is a favorite at this vegetarian-friendly fine-dining spot. And though its ingredients evoke Indonesia, the plates are all over the map: sticky eggplant sushi, BBQ octopus, Turkish meatballs, moussaka, and crispy fried chicken. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Bali is during both the summer holiday months and the local festive season. \\n The biggest holiday of the year is Nyepi, which happens in March and involves fantastical parades of men and boys hauling ogoh-ogoh (huge handmade demon dolls) the night before a 24-hour silent day, on which even the airport falls quiet, and planes don\\'t take off or land, and the use of electricity and vehicles is forbidden. For that period, tourists must stay on the grounds of their accommodations, but it\\'s a beautiful opportunity to experience Balinese culture as well as epic stargazing. Surfers will find the best waves on the west coast of Bali from May to October, at which point the winds shift and it improves on the eastern side. \\n \"Being an equatorial getaway boasting a consistently delightful climate, this destination attracts globetrotters from across the world, regardless of whether it\\'s the dry or rainy season,\" Faggioli shared. \"Nevertheless, my ultimate preference rests with the period spanning from June to August. During these months, the sun graces the skies daily, and the weather is very nice.\" \\n Bali doesn\\'t experience four seasons in the same way we do. Instead, there are just two: rainy and dry. When it rains, it really pours, but there can also be beautiful days during that humid period, from November to March. April to October tends to be far drier and equally hot, though nights can feel quite cool. Daytime temperatures hover in the high 70s and 80s Fahrenheit year-round. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Plane: Because Bali is an island, the practical to get there is by plane. Visitors will fly into its one international airport, Denpasar-Ngurah Rai International Airport, which services flights from all over the world. \\n Ferry: There are also plentiful ferries that travel from the mainland of Indonesia to Bali. See all the available ferry terminals and times here. \\n Cruise: One more option is to book a cruise that stops in Bali as one of its ports of call. Several cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises, make stops here. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n This is Bali\\'s most known beach neighborhood, and without a doubt, its busiest. There are literally countless places to shop, eat, and drink along its vibrant, crowded streets, not to mention hundreds of deluxe villas and many luxury hotels. Partying isn\\'t contained to after-dark hours — beach clubs like Potato Head and Ku De Ta are popular at all times of day and night. \\n Think of Canggu as the newer Seminyak — super hip and, in recent years, where a burst of development has occurred, bringing this seaside beach town plenty of cool little boutiques. Plus, loads of eateries and bars are helmed by chefs from around the world, bringing not only international flavors but aesthetics. \\n Ever since Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s \"Eat Pray Love\" threw Ubud (pronounced oo-bood) into the spotlight, it\\'s become almost every tourist\\'s definition of Bali. That\\'s ironic considering the island is known for its beaches, and this busy, sprawling town full of yoga studios, vegan cafes, shops, spas, and markets is a 30-minute motorbike ride from the nearest stretch of sand. Still, it\\'s probably the most popular stop in Bali, a great jumping-off point for temple visits, hikes (Mt. Batur is lovely at sunrise), visits with healers, coffee (kopi) tastings, and a serious dose of culture. \\n If you surf, you\\'ve already heard of Uluwatu. Besides its epic waves, the southwesternmost tip of Bali is famed for Pura Uluwatu, the clifftop Hindu temple where monkeys cause mischief as sarong-clad visitors take in panoramic sunsets. Uluwatu and its neighboring surf towns of Padang Padang and Bingin are lower key than Canggu, with more dramatically beautiful beaches (most of which require a decent number of steps to access) and a laid-back but luscious restaurant and cafe scene. \\n This tiny island off the southeastern coast is technically part of Bali (along with the even teenier Nusa Ceningan and much larger but less developed Nusa Penida), but is about 20 years behind developmentally, which means it\\'s a bit closer to the storied Bali of yore. Still, there are already plenty of Instagrammable hotels and eateries here, so if you\\'re keen for some scuba diving, snorkeling, or more surf, it makes for a fun few-day spinoff (the fast boat from Sanur or Serangan takes about 30 minutes). \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Motorbike: Bali does not have a public transit system in the Western sense — there are some buses, but not reliable or advised. Instead, the ubiquitous motorbikes that flood every street (and sometimes sidewalk) are the primary mode of transportation. There are plentiful rental services to assist in finding the bike for you.Taxi: If the idea of riding one stresses you out (and it should a bit, the experience is not for the timid), there are plentiful taxis for hire. Uber is not available in Bali, so go with a local service instead. \\n Private car: There are also abundant private cars with gracious Balinese drivers who will happily be on call to ferry you around the island, many of whom double as casual tour guides. \\n Rental cars: Almost every rental car service operates in Bali and is available from the airport. If you plan to see a lot of the area it is a good idea to rent your own car, or like the above, hire a private driver, to take you around. \\n',\n",

Climb the Sky Bars at night and be rewarded with a sparkling metropolis twinkling in its glory. \\n Sashaying with the sweet, the sour, and everything in between, there is no denying that the Land of Smiles will capture your senses and your heart. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Indochina Time (ICT) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Thai Buddhist New Year (otherwise known as \\'Songkran\\') is a celebration the locals (of all ages) eagerly await all year round. On April 13, this metropolitan city shuts down for a three-day holiday. The locals then proceed to the streets, to have what can only be described as the biggest water festival in the world! \\n If the thought of this screams adventure to you, then don\\'t forget to pack your brightest floral shirt and your best water gun! Check out Bangkok\\'s Silom, a neighborhood where the atmosphere is pumping, the roads are closed off and the water barrels are lining the streets. \\n The easiest way to get there is by hopping on the BTS Skytrain (Silom or dark green line) and following the herds of brightly patterned shirts. Upon exiting the station, you will be greeted with some friendly, splashin\\' fun. If having water thrown on you randomly in the street isn\\'t really your thing, then avoiding most parts of this country, at this time of year, is probably a good idea! \\n FYI: This time of year is HOT, HOT, HOT. In fact, April is known for being the hottest month of the year, so if you are averse to strong heat and humidity do check out the cooler months of the year. \\n Throughout the months of January and February, Bangkok proudly presents the very chilled Concert in the Park. Starting at 5:30 p.m. every Sunday, the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra plays a two-hour set, consisting of stunning compositions from both Thai and Western music. You can expect to hear plenty of popular classics from the big movies, musicals, and pop band heroes. Do as the locals do by taking a blanket or folding chairs, plus your favourite picnic essentials. You\\'ll be ready to settle in and soak up the atmosphere. \\n November to February are generally the cooler months in most parts of Thailand, including Bangkok. However, if you\\'re planning a trip to the islands from the capital do check the weather carefully. Whilst some areas of northern Thailand are determined by the three distinct climates, there are southern regions governed by just two. These areas are known for getting more rainfall. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Bangkok is a huge bustling city with a population of over 10 million and its bold colours and cool vibrations span over 50 districts making it impossible to absorb it all in a single trip. With so much to see and do, this is a city that loves an itinerary. It\\'s also a city that loves wandering feet — being ready to trail off the beaten path and throw away the schedule could pay off in dividends. \\n Bangkok Soi\\'s (streets/alleys) are well known for their hidden gems. Some have more pop-ups than a pogo stick, so being prepared to go with the flow could full-well deliver the magic you never expected. \\n Get used to the idea of using the BTS Skytrain and the MRT rail lines, otherwise getting anywhere fast will likely be a stickler for your trip. Traffic can be a deadlock, especially at peak times of the day. Planning your mode of transport ahead of time could be the key to unlocking extra time in a mind-blowing city. \\n The city is a food haven for anyone who loves hearty and flavorsome cooking. With so many dishes to try, do your palate a favour and start off with the following favourites: Khao Soi, Pad Thai, Som Tam, Massaman Curry, Laab, Pak Boong, and Penang Curry. And there\\'s plenty more where they came from. With a mix of unique textures, flavors, and cultural influences, don\\'t be surprised if you fall in love with authentic Thai cuisine. \\n The Thai people generally pride themselves on being respectful and polite, with this you can expect to be greeted with the Wai (palms together at your chest accompanied with a subtle bow of the head) — reciprocate to share the warm sentiment. It is illegal to defame or insult the King or any members of the royal family. To avoid any misunderstanding, steer clear of any mention of his royal highness. \\n Find flights:AirAsia: https://www.airasia.com/en/gb \\n Currency:Baht (BHT) 1.00 US Dollar = 31.145097 Thai Baht \\n Language:Thai \\n To express gratitude and warm regards, always add khap (only if you\\'re male), or ka(only if you\\'re female) at the end of everything you say, this will score you brownie points with the locals. Khap or Ka is considered a polite way to show respect. \\n Hello & Goodbye:Sawasdee (sa- whah- dee) (add: Ka/Khap) \\n Thank you: Kohp koon (add: Ka/Khap) \\n Yes: Chı̀ No: Mi (add: Ka/Khap) \\n I don\\'t speak Thai: C̄hạn mị̀ phūd p̣hās̄ʹā thịy \\n I\\'m lost: C̄hạn h̄lng thāng \\n I would like: C̄hạn t̂xngkār \\n Learn more Thai phrases with IHG: Translator APP. \\n Calling Code: +66 \\n Capital City: Bangkok \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Tessa Desjardins/Travel + Leiusre \\n Bangkok is brimming with transport options and choosing the right mode that is fit for your journey is vital. \\n Trains: The BTS Skytrain is most likely the most convenient way to reach your destination in the shortest time possible. There are sixty-one stations along three main lines, and it\\'s extending every day. This mode of transport is cheaper than taxis and covers all the major Bangkok neighborhoods. Sukhumvit and Silom being the most popular lines for locals and tourists alike. With waiting times averaging less than five minutes, you can hop on this friendly service and know that you\\'ll experience the convenience of time, as well as air conditioned and clean carriages. Be prepared to be \\'packed in\\' during peak times. Have cash available to buy instant tickets from the machines or take your passport to purchase a Rabbit Card for regular Skytrain use. Your journey will start from around $0.45 for one stop. If you know you\\'ll be making good use of the service, take your passport and buy a rabbit card. Sticking $10 on it should have you covered for a while, and you can top up anytime. The best part is claiming back the cost of the card (and what you didn\\'t spend) at the end of your trip is easy. Just return it to any Skytrain kiosk. \\n The MRT is Bangkok\\'s rapid underground rail system. Like the Skytrain, the MRT has a quick turnaround and covers vast areas of Bangkok, including the old quarters. Take cash to exchange for tokens or cards. \\n Both BTS and the MRT are interconnected at popular stations for seamless overlaps in city travel. \\n Taxis: Bangkok taxis are everywhere and come in an array of funky colours, adding a wash of blue, orange, pink, green, and yellow to an already vivacious bustling scene. Even though flagging a cab down is relatively easy, depending on the time of day, a 10-minute journey may end up taking an hour or so. Traffic is relentlessly jammed pretty much everywhere you go, especially during peak times. \\n It\\'s also worth noting that some drivers may not have the meter on when you get in, this happens a lot in tourist areas. Be sure to check and ask for \"Meter kah/khap?\" before you hop in. \\n Generally, it\\'s very normal for a driver to communicate with you via the passenger window before unlocking the doors and letting you in. Having maps open and your address pinned for easy view can speed up the process. \\n Paying: Carrying loose coins and small notes is a good way to avoid being (unintentionally) short changed. Some drivers may claim they don\\'t have small coins/notes to give back to you. When you come to pay, round up your fare to the nearest five or 10 baht, this can also make the transaction easier for both parties. \\n Motorbike Taxis: A popular (and fun) way to travel for short distances, particularly from train stations. The bikes can get into the nooks and crannies of the Soi\\'s and easily duck and dive their way through the hot traffic. Having some basic Thai is recommended, as is being able to communicate your destination. Carrying your own helmet is highly advised, but most will provide one, if you ask. \\n Basic language to learn: \\n Go Left: Pị thāng ŝāy \\n Go Right: Pị thāng k̄hwā \\n Straight on: Trng pị \\n Stop here: H̄yud trng nī̂ \\n Tuk-Tuk: A cultural emblem and still a somewhat reliable mode of transport in the heart of Bangkok. Flagging one down shouldn\\'t be too difficult, especially around the tourist area of Siam. Prices will vary wildly and a 10-minute spin could set you back around 300baht. Sharpening up the bartering skills may be essential. Some hotels will have their own free Tuk-Tuk ready and waiting to drop guests at the nearest BTS/MRT station. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Ariyasom Villa\\n\\n Address: 65 Sukhumvit Soi 1, Klongtoey Nua, Wattana, Bangkok 10110, ThailandPhone: +662-254 8880-3Book Now \\n Nestled in the popular area of Sukhumvit, this authentic boutique Thai hotel is close to a bedrock of shopping malls such as Emquartier, Siam Paragon, and Central world.

The temperate climate, too, makes the weather quite pleasant for most of the year. \\n When vacationing in a new place — especially an historic city — it\\'s easy to get caught up in the I-must-see-everything-as-quickly-as-possible mentality. And while Barça has no shortage of things to see and do, the city imparts a distinct sense of relaxation on those who pass through. Be sure to reserve time to experience life like the locals do, enjoying leisurely lunches followed by siesta, vermuteria hopping on Sundays, and frequenting your neighborhood bar for tapas and wine with friends. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Early summer or autumn are the best times to visit Barcelona, as late summer tends to get hot and humid. Book your trip in May, June, September, or October for the most idyllic weather — you\\'ll encounter plenty of sun and nice temperatures for swimming and walking about the city\\'s stunning streets, parks, and markets. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Barcelona is the capital and largest city of Catalonia, where both Spanish and Catalan are the predominant languages spoken. The city is a transportation hub and one of southwestern Europe\\'s economic centers — also known as Spain\\'s leading biotech city. \\n Meal times are all generally on the late side in Barcelona. Restaurants are typically open from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. for lunch, and from 8:30 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. for dinner. Many stores close for lunchtime siesta (2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.), as well as on Sundays and public holidays. \\n Europe\\'s largest stadium is Camp Nou in Barcelona with a capacity of over 99,000 occupants, and is home to FC Barcelona (one of the most supported fútbol teams in the world). \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Metro: The Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) is the main transport system in Barcelona, operating both the metro line and select bus routes. Riders can purchase tickets at metro stations across the city. Single tickets cost €2.40 or you can buy a T-Casual ticket for multi-trip use. \\n Trains: The main railway station in Barcelona is the Barcelona Sants. The FGC is a network of trains in Barcelona and the surrounding suburbs which connects the city to other towns in Catalonia. The Renfe is an international high-speed railway line that connects Spain and France, allowing travelers to get to cities like Paris, Marseille, and Madrid quickly. \\n Buses: The TMB operates all throughout the city and travelers can purchase tickets both at stops and on the bus, although you\\'re only able to purchase single rides on the bus. There\\'s also the Aerobús BCN, which connects Barcelona Airport with the city center. \\n Taxis: Typically affordable, accessible, and all over the city day and night. \\n Car service: While Uber operates throughout Spain, it is not currently available in Barcelona. Cabify is a favored alternative for ride sharing. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 700, Barcelona 08010, SpainPhone: +34 93 545 80 70Book Now \\n Casa Bonay\\'s bread and butter is creating simple, sustainable spaces that impart a sense of local culture and community onto guests.

              "  'Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n From beaches and mangrove swamps to rainforests and mountains, Belize is known for its biodiversity. Ancient Mayan archeological sites, remote islands, waterfalls, and the world\\'s second largest barrier reef attract visitors to the country\\'s natural beauty. \\n “We offer visitors the best of both worlds, with the reef and the rainforest being in such close proximity, where you can spend your morning doing jungle adventures and by evening you are on the beach,” Jana Puga, the branding and hospitality specialist at the Belize Tourism Board, told Travel + Leisure. \"We are a proud nation very committed to preserving our heritage and natural resources.\" \\n Belize is located on Central America\\'s northeastern coast just south of Mexico. It borders the Caribbean Sea and consists of a diverse mainland area and about 450 islands called \"cays\" or \"cayes\" (pronounced \"keys\"). Belize is also home to the longest cave system in Central America. \\n English is the official language of Belize, and visitors will also hear the local Kriol language spoken. “The country has a unique history because it is the only country in Central America that was colonized by the British, making English the official language,\" Puga said. \\n The use of English makes travel easy for Americans, as does the country’s use of U.S. dollars, along with Belizean Dollars. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n This luxury property is set right on the water on Ambergris Caye and features spacious guest rooms, suites, and three-bedroom beachfront villas. Amenities include a full-service spa, six restaurants, four bars, and three pools, including a suspended rooftop pool and lounge with views over the ocean. \\n Set on its own five-star, four-acre island off San Pedro on Ambergris Caye, Cayo Espanto offers luxury beachfront one- and two-bedroom villas as well as a spacious 1,100-square-foot overwater bungalow with a private dock. The cuisine is all-inclusive and comes paired with world-class wines. The quiet, private island is also outfitted with its own spa and operates daily trips and tours, including fishing, scuba diving, and birdwatching. \\n This eco-lodge is located along the Macal River in the foothills of the Maya Mountains about two hours southwest of Belize City. The hotel is set on a private 400-acre nature preserve, which boasts its own butterfly farm, and their motto, “Wildly civilized,” pretty much sums up the experience. Guests are encouraged to coexist with nature during their stay, with accommodations that include eco-pods, tree-top suites, and villas with private plunge pools. \\n One of the best all-inclusive resorts in Belize is set on a 14-acre private island just 30 miles southeast of Belize City. The luxurious Turneffe Island Resort is a favorite with travelers who love fishing, diving, and snorkeling. Guests arrive by boat or helicopter from the international airport where they\\'re met by a resort representative. A variety of guest rooms and beachfront villas are available. \\n This luxury boutique hideaway hotel is set in western Belize in the 107,000-acre Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve among tropical trees, shrubs, waterfalls, and jungle. Twenty elegant accommodations include cabanas, villas, and the ultra-luxe Francis Ford Coppola\\'s Villa, which has two bedrooms, a private plunge pool, and a spacious hardwood deck set in a lush tropical garden. Montagna Ristorante features Italian cuisine, and poolside and garden dining are also available. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n Known to divers around the world, the Great Blue Hole is part of the Belize Barrier Reef, which is a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. The circular-shaped Blue Hole gets its rich color from its depth — at its deepest, it reaches more than 400 feet. Geological formations and a variety of coral, tropical fish, sharks, shrimp, and unique marine life make up the site’s main attractions.\\xa0French explorer Jacques Cousteau called it one of the top 10 dive sites in the world. And since it is just 45 minutes from the mainland by boat, it’s a no-brainer for any diver who finds themselves in Belize. \\n Puga noted that “Belize has the world’s first jaguar preserve,” which is part of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in south-central Belize. The sanctuary protects 122,260 acres of subtropical forest in the Maya Mountains, which are home to the mighty jaguar. And while your chances of seeing a jaguar are extremely unlikely — although they may see you — you might catch glimpses of howler monkeys, jaguarundi (a small, wild cat), the pig-like peccary, and over 300 bird species. \\n loeskieboom/Getty Images \\n There are many Mayan archaeological sites in Belize, but Altun Ha is easily the most accessible. There are plenty of tours running from Belize City and San Pedro, and the site is under 1 hour by car from the heart of the capital. That said, Altun Ha’s accessibility is also its curse. It is noticeably busier than the other Mayan sites, so if you have the time, consider visiting Caracol, which is the largest site; Lamanai, which is in the jungle; and Xunantunich, which is known for its Mayan hieroglyphics. \\n Belize has over 200 miles of Caribbean coastline, providing more than enough beach space for those looking to throw down a towel, open a book, and chill. But one of the most iconic beaches — and ironically, the most well-known — is Secret Beach on Ambergris Caye. This island-bound beach has all-day music, food, and drinks in addition to white sand and clear water. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n As Puga confirmed, this rooftop restaurant has an “amazing view of the city, coastline, and sunsets.” The restaurant and bar is perched on top of the Golden Bay Belize Hotel and serves a Caribbean-inspired menu alongside a wide variety of cocktails, beer, and wine. On Sundays, it’s a great place to get breakfast with a view. \\n This eatery on San Pedro is known for its unique style of cooking:\\xa0each dish is cooked over an open fire. El Fogon is a favorite of Puga’s, who noted that the “authentic Belizean food is prepared on traditional fire hearth.” Fare includes Belikin fried chicken, beef soup, ceviche, and lobster. \\n Also known simply as “The Brew Barge,” this restaurant on Punta Placencia is unique in that its located on a barge, which Puga said “sits on the lagoon of the peninsula.” The unique dining experience is complemented by a creative cocktail list, beer flights, and ongoing live music. \\n This is oceanfront dining at its best. The views and breeze are impossible to top (or replicate) and the food is wildly unique. The Love On The Rocks menu relies on lava stones to cook the food, a method used by the ancient Mayans of Belize. Beyond the stone-cooked menu, this eatery has a cocktail list that was made for the beach. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Times to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Belize is between late November and May. The climate in this Central American country is comfortable year-round, but the weather varies greatly by region. Rain tends to be heaviest in southern Belize and the country’s jungle areas, and the lightest in northern Belize and on the many Belizean cays or islands. The driest months tend to be February through May and the rainiest months are August through October.\\xa0Those willing to travel to Belize during the rainy season will be treated to lower prices, abundant wildlife, and flowers in bloom. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Most international flights arrive at Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport (BZE), which is just 15 miles northwest of Belize City, the country’s capital. From the international airport, visitors can hail a taxi into the city, head to the ferry, or hop on a connecting, local flight to their final destination. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Islands to Visit\\n\\n Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n If you want to visit one of the islands off mainland Belize, chances are your journey will start in San Pedro Town in the southern part of Ambergris Caye. Whether it’s your final stop or a stopover, make sure to walk the sandy streets, visit one of the many beach bars, and explore the nearby Hol Chan Marine Reserve, which has diving among parrot fish, nurse sharks, and eels.\\xa0\"If you are someone looking for an island vacation and multiple options for nightlife and dining, San Pedro is a must-visit,\" said Puga. \\n Alessandra Amodio/Travel + Leisure \\n Between Belize City and San Pedro is Caye Caulker, a tiny coral island with lots of diving, and snorkeling, and a famous manatee population.\\xa0“If you’re not already staying there, a day trip to Caye Caulker to experience activities at ‘The Split,’ the tarpon viewing, and other family-friendly activities,” said Puga. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Traveling around Belize is fairly easy, according to Puga. If you are staying on mainland Belize and want to travel at will, she recommended renting a car, noting that “it is very easy to move around, as we only have five major highways.” \\n Those who are headed to the islands will find that “golf carts and bicycles are the preferred means of transportation.” And if you plan to only visit a couple of places during your time in Belize, Puga said there is “public transportation, transfer companies, puddle jumpers, and ferries available.” \\n If you want to get to the islands, check the San Pedro Belize Express Water Taxi schedule. The ferry system runs regularly from Belize City to San Pedro and Caye Caulker. \\n',\n",
              "  'Berlin is a place of stark contrasts. On one hand, reminders of its turbulent past are everywhere. But it\\'s also a modern megalopolis—that\\'s geographically nine times bigger than Paris—with exciting new attractions and an inherent subversiveness. This juxtaposition makes it a destination unlike any other. \\n The big question for most travelers when venturing to Germany\\'s once war-torn capital then becomes how to navigate the past while living in the present. It\\'s essential to confront the heavier aspects of the city\\'s history. However, that doesn\\'t mean a visit to Berlin is all memorials and museums. (Though, it bears repeating that you should absolutely carve out ample time to do all that.) The contemporary side of things very much deserves exploration, too. \\n An artsy mecca with a slew of galleries and eccentric installations, Berlin transformed the last pieces of the wall that once divided it into a permanent open-air exhibition. \\n This sprawling city also has a wild side with nightlife at its center. There are hedonistic drinking dens with cabaret acts, swanky speakeasies and anything-goes clubs where people party for 48 hours (that\\'s not an exaggeration). Add to that picturesque parks, a thriving food scene that\\'s garnered international acclaim of late, a world-class zoo and a cool aesthetic sensibility with homegrown designers making a global name for themselves. \\n Overwhelmed? Berlin tends to have that effect on out-of-towners. Bookmark this guide to help plan your first (or next) trip. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n CEST (Central European Summer Time) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n May through October is the peak travel period in Berlin. Temperatures tend to be moderate, making it a lovely time to walk around, see the historic sites, hang out in the many green spaces and enjoy al fresco dining. Winter isn\\'t the season that most tourists visit due to the less welcoming weather. However, holiday festivities—notably the fabled Christmas markets—are a bright light in the middle of what can feel like a very long, grey few months. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: German \\n Calling Code: +49 \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n U-Bahn: The most convenient and efficient way to navigate Berlin, the U-Bahn, or subway system, has a total of 10 lines stopping at 173 stations. During the day, the iconic yellow U-Bahn trains depart every five minutes. At night, they leave in 10-minute intervals. Tickets are also valid across the Transport Association Berlin-Brandenburg VBB-operated S-Bahn, buses and trams. \\n S-Bahn: The S-Bahn is a network of suburban train lines that covers 15 lines and nearly 170 train stations. In the city center, it mostly runs above ground. \\n Buses:Metro buses M11 to M85 run 24/7. Day bus lines 100 to 399 connect the suburbs and city center. Night buses—which are marked with an N—cover the day bus and U-Bahn routes that cease operating overnight. \\n Trams & Metrotrams: Upwards of 20 tram lines extend the network of the U-Bahn through the eastern part of Berlin. The difference between trams and metrotrams is frequency, with the latter running more often. \\n Taxis: Public transport in Berlin is fantastic—and would be our recommendation. That said, if you\\'d rather take a car, taxis are widely available. \\n Rideshare: Prefer to hail an Uber? That\\'s also an option. \\n Bicycles: Bike sharing is a convenient and eco-friendly way to get around thanks to companies like Nextbike and Donkey Republic. While electric bikes are available to rent through Wheels, Jump and LimeBike. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Hotel de Rome\\n\\n Address: Behrenstraße 37, 10117 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 4606090Website \\n Located on Bebelplatz in historic East Berlin, Hotel de Rome occupies what was once the headquarters of 19th-century Dresden Bank.

While sleek furnishings and colorful accents add modern flair to the mix. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Orania.Berlin\\n\\n Address: Oranienstraße 40, 10999 Berlin, Germany \\n Phone: +49 30 69539680 \\n Website: orania.berlin \\n An upscale addition to the edgier side of Kreuzberg, Oriana.Berlin is a boutique stay with an elevated yet totally laid-back sensibility. It\\'s impossible to pinpoint the singular thing that makes this hotel so stellar, however, the subtle Asian influences—headboards swathed in elephant-printed fabric and signature crispy-skinned duck at the restaurant—as well as jazz in the open-concept lobby, definitely play a part. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hotel am Steinplatz, Autograph Collection\\n\\n Address: Steinpl. 4, 10623 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 5544440Website \\n The same air of glamour and sophistication that lured the likes of Brigitte Bardo to Hotel am Steinplatz remains today.

The 1930s neoclassical edifice, built by KaDeWe architect Johann Emil Schaudt, certainly gives off a regal first impression. Inside the former Royal Danish Embassy, it\\'s just as resplendent with an eye-catching white marble staircase and dazzling, larger-than-life chandelier. Direct access to the Berlin Zoo is a bonus. \\n \\n\\nHeading: 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin\\n\\n Address: Budapester Str. 40, 10787 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 1202210Website \\n Hip, youthful, off-beat, and affordable—25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin serves up major cool factor. It\\'s the type of place you\\'d go to hang out even if you weren\\'t a guest. Of course, staying at this urban oasis does come with a bunch of perks such as enjoying the jungle-themed rooms and skipping the line for the rooftop cocktail bar. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hotel Adlon Kempinski\\n\\n Address: Unter den Linden 77, 10117 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 22610Website \\n Boasting (arguably) the most desirable addresses in Berlin, Hotel Adlon Kempinski sits directly across the way from Brandenburg Gate. Enviable location aside, this five-star property is a revered landmark for so many other reasons. From the opulent lobby and spacious suites to the Michelin-starred restaurant, grandeur and elegance are the very heart of everything. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Hackethals (German)\\n\\n Address: Pflugstrasse 11, 10115 Berlin GermanyPhone: +49 30 28387765Website \\n When in Berlin, you must try traditional German food. Hackethals is a cozy gastropub that does classics right. Order the sauerkraut, potato dumplings, schnitzel, and slow-cooked venison. Be sure to leave room for apple strudel. To wash it down? Beer, of course. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Restaurant Tim Raue (Fine Dining)\\n\\n Address: Rudi-Dutschke-Straße 26, 10969 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 25937930Website \\n Berlin-born chef Tim Raue needs no introduction. Neither does the elevated Asian-inspired menu at his Michelin-rated restaurant, which continually receives rave reviews from critics and diners alike. Needless to say, reservations are required. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Curry 61 (German)\\n\\n Address: Oranienburger Str. 6, 10178 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 40054033Website \\n Currywurst (pork sausage smothered in curried ketchup and served alongside fries) is an extremely popular street food in Berlin. You can sample it all over the city, but Curry 61 makes one of the best versions of this crowd-pleasing dish. Try it and thank us later. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Eins44 (Modern European)\\n\\n Address: Elbestraße 28/29, 12045 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 62981212Website \\n Sublime isn\\'t a word that we toss around a lot. However, it\\'s the most accurate way to describe the entire experience at Eins44. Enter the industrial-inspired eatery, inside an old distillery, and prepare to have your taste buds tickled by an unfussy interpretation of modern European fine dining. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Panama (German)\\n\\n Address: Potsdamer Straße 91, 10785 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 983208435Website \\n Oftentimes, you have to choose between Michelin-starred fare and a fun vibe. That couldn\\'t be less true of Panama. The modern German cuisine, lively two-floor space and service are fantastic. Did we mention the craft cocktails and interesting wine list? \\n \\n\\nHeading: Mustafa\\'s Gemüse Kebap (Turkish)\\n\\n Address: Mehringdamm 32, 10961 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n Mustafa\\'s Gemüse Kebap in Kreuzberg is one of those places that\\'s just universally adored. The only downside? Depending on when you visit, the queue might stretch an entire city block. We promise it\\'s worth waiting just to dig into a juicy döner kebab. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: East Side Gallery\\n\\n Address: Mühlenstraße 3-100, 10243 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 2517159Website \\n What was once a symbol of division now reflects the spirit and resilience of the city. Perched along the banks of Spree River in Friedrichshain, the 4,318-foot-long East Side Gallery showcases a collection of colorful murals painted on the surviving pieces of the Berlin Wall. It\\'s a beautiful metaphor that\\'s so very Berlin. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Reichstag Building\\n\\n Address: Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 22732152Website \\n Like so much of Berlin, the Reichstag Building has lived many lives. Today, it again houses the German parliament. Admire the neo-Baroque edifice from the outside or book in advance to step inside the Sir Norman Foster-designed glass dome. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Brandenburg Gate\\n\\n Address: Pariser Platz, 10117 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n One block south of the Reichstag Building stands Brandenburg Gate. Widely considered to be Berlin\\'s most iconic landmark, it\\'s a shining symbol of freedom and reunification after four decades of Cold War division. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\\n\\n Address: Cora-Berliner-Straße 1, 10117 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 2639430Website \\n Designed by architect Peter Eisenman and engineer Buro Happold, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe honors the Jewish victims of the Holocaust. It\\'s a heartbreaking and incredibly important reminder of what happened that should be mandatory to visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Tempelhofer Feld\\n\\n Address: Tempelhofer Damm, 12101 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 700906710Website \\n An abandoned airport turned 355-hectare public park, Tempelhofer Feld delivers that telltale mashup of past and present in the most Berlin way possible. You can stroll, cycle, or skate down the concrete runways where WWII dive-bombers took off, while feet away dogs run after frisbees and bikini-clad Berliners sunbathe. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Berghain\\n\\n Address: Am Wriezener Bahnhof, 10243 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n Berliners love to party. As such, there are a lot of after-dark venues to do just that. But none compare to Berghain. The world\\'s most infamous club invites revelers to leave their inhibitions behind, dance to techno beats and give in to every debaucherous whim. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Museum Island\\n\\n Address: Bodestraße 1-3 10178 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n On a small island in the Spree River sits a collection of five prominent museums.

It\\'s actually the second-largest department store in all of Europe after Harrods in London. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sing Blackbird\\n\\n Address: Sanderstraße 11, 12047 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n Berlin isn\\'t lacking in vintage stores. Sing Blackbird sets itself apart thanks to an expertly curated selection of pre-loved pieces, plus a stylish café. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Kurfürstendamm\\n\\n Address: Kurfürstendamm 10707 Berlin, GermanyWebsite \\n Often compared to the Champs-Élysées in Paris, Kurfürstendamm in Charlottenburg is lined with high-end designers like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. If you don\\'t have that kind of cash, it\\'s also a great place for window shopping. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Amazing Crocodile Design Store\\n\\n Address: Raumerstraße 23, 10437 Berlin, GermanyPhone: +49 30 40006930Website \\n Fancy an upside-down geometric pendant lamp or neon pink floor mirror?

Mitte (which literally means \"middle\") lies in the center of the city. Not only is this sprawling borough chock-full of top sights—including Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, and Tiergarten—but also cafes, bars, and shops. Another major selling point? Public transport. Basically, every train line runs through the main railway station, Berlin Hauptbahnhof. \\n Kreuzberg: People often liken bohemian Kreuzberg to Brooklyn, but there\\'s really no accurate comparison. Of late, a spate of hip bars and trendy restaurants have popped up at a breakneck pace. Yet much of Kreuzberg still clings to its grittiness like a badge of honor. On one corner, a beautiful community garden and art installation. Veer left and you\\'ll arrive on a gentrification-resistant street scattered with broken beer bottles and graffiti-covered buildings. And that\\'s the beauty of this enigmatic, multicultural hood. \\n Charlottenburg: Charlottenburg could accurately be categorized as the more upscale side of Berlin. Graceful pre-war buildings, five-star hotels, top-rated restaurants, and designer boutiques dot the litter-free boulevards. The stately Charlottenburg Palace has ornate interiors and manicured gardens, while Berggruen Museum displays an incredible collection of modern art. \\n Neukölln: A diverse district known for its eclectic, international vibe, the bustling streets of Neukölln brim with Middle Eastern bakeries, vegan eateries, bars, breweries, and artists studios. Check out a poetry slam at Heimathafen Neukölln and shop for fragrant spices at the Turkish Market. \\n Schöneberg: The epicenter of nightlife back in the 1920s, today Schöneberg is the hub of LGBTQIA culture. It\\'s home to an array of bars, cafes, galleries and shops, including Kaufhaus des Westens, as well as Natur-Park Südgelände. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Things begin to thaw in the spring.

              "  'shunyufan/Getty Images \\n Named one of the best islands in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and the Bahamas by Travel + Leisure readers in 2022, Bermuda is a true island paradise. This British territory is famous for its\\xa0pink-sand beaches\\xa0and laid-back island vibe. A popular spot for tourists but fiercely protective of its strong sense of identity, Bermuda\\'s vibe is upscale, artsy, and naturally wild. \\n T+L editors named the island as one of the best places to visit in 2023 due to its new $400-million airport terminal, hotel openings and renovations (see The St. Regis Bermuda Resort and Cambridge Beaches Resort & Spa), and new airline routes to the island, including a direct flight from LaGuardia Airport in Queens. Make plans to come at the beginning of the year, when the island\\'s film festival and restaurant weeks take place. Or, visit during the summer to enjoy the dancing and music of Bermuda\\'s Carnival. \\n Despite its popularity with visitors, Bermuda is hardly touristy: tacky souvenir shops are few, and commercialized clutter like fast-food chains are banned (save for one pre-existing KFC that was grandfathered in). This North Atlantic island is about 900 miles north of the Caribbean islands and boasts glorious weather all year long. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Opened in 1923, Cambridge Beaches Resort & Spa reopened in 2022 after a major renovation — and was voted as one of the best new hotels of 2023 by T+L editors. Much of its original architecture remains, including 100-year-old coral stone walls. The 86-room resort features four private beaches, indoor and outdoor pools, multiple sports courts, and a full-service spa. Sip classic island cocktails surrounded by sunken treasure (recovered by Bermudian diver Teddy Tucker) at The Sunken Harbor Club, a nautical-themed bar that also has an outpost in Brooklyn, New York. \\n The Marriott brand returned to the island of Bermuda, where it has not had a presence since 1999, with the opening of The St. Regis Bermuda Resort in May 2021. Its \"bespoke service, exquisite design, outstanding culinary venues, and historic Five Forts Golf Course\" — as Jan Vanhaelewyn, the resort\\'s general manager, previously told T+L — makes for a relaxing and luxurious retreat in a picturesque setting. \\n The Loren is located in Bermuda\\'s East End. The hotel is right on the beach and is known for thoughtful amenities, including a custom soundtrack that plays throughout the day. \"The Loren,\" Stephen King, the hotel\\'s developer, said previously to T+L, \"shows what Bermuda can be.\" \\n The five-star Hamilton Princess is a hotel, beach club, and marina all in one. Its pink exterior has been an iconic sight on the island for over a century. Plus, it\\'s just a five-minute walk from downtown Hamilton. \\n Grotto Bay Beach Resort is the only hotel in Bermuda that offers an all-inclusive option. Jay Correia, the president of\\xa0Swizzle Ltd, said the resort has a welcoming family-friendly atmosphere and offers \"a great beach and [options for] water sports.\" Stretching over 21 acres along beautiful Bailey\\'s Bay, the real draw of Grotto Bay Beach Resort is its spa: the hotel is home to crystal caves coated in 500,000-year-old stalactites and stalagmites with crystal-clear water beneath, one of the most awe-inspiring settings in the world for a massage. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n One of the most awe-inspiring views in Bermuda, the Crystal Caves, are a must on any Bermuda vacation. Visitors descend underground to deep, super-clear pools surrounded on all sides by stalagmites and stalactites, an experience to be explored via floating bridges. Tours are given daily; reservations not required. \\n After a string of shipwrecks on Bermuda\\'s West End, where coral reefs extend 16 miles from shore, construction began on Gibb\\'s Hill Lighthouse in 1844. Because steel was not a viable building material at the time, it was one of the few lighthouses in the world made of cast iron. Today, visitors can climb its 185 steps for unbeatable views of Bermuda\\'s mind-blowing greens and blues. \\n Bermuda\\'s beaches are among the main reasons to visit. There are many gorgeous beaches around the island, but the curved Horseshoe Bay Beach is one of the most popular in Bermuda, thanks to its iconic pink sands and azure water. Looking to dive in the magnificent water? Reach out to the folks at Dive Bermuda to schedule a tour. \\n The majority of Bermudians have African ancestry, with many descended from people captured and sold into slavery during the 1700s. Explore the African Diaspora Heritage Trail to learn their history and the legacies they forged in spite of intense persecution. Featured sites include the National Museum of Bermuda, the Bermuda Heritage Museum, Cobbs Hill Methodist Church, and various statues, sculptures, and historic homes. \\n The historic Lili Bermuda Perfumery was established in 1928 and has been sharing Bermuda\\'s story through scent ever since. Complimentary tours of the perfumery, which cover techniques of perfume-making and reveal where and how they age their perfumes, are held daily (except Sundays and public holidays) at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. No reservation is required. Another fun activity at the perfumery, which provides a taste of the island\\'s British roots, is traditional afternoon tea, held on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons (reservation required). \\n Read More: The Best Things to Do in Bermuda \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Blending both classic and modern, new and vintage, this two-story boutique is one of the most beloved shops in Bermuda: you can find everything from locally made jewelry to items salvaged from shipwrecks to home goods, apparel, and accessories. \\n Owned by Bermudian blogger and entrepreneur Kristin White, the gift shop and tour center — which she describes as \"my dope emporium of wonderment\" — is curated with a focus on social progress, the African Diaspora, women, and environmental sustainability. You\\'ll find everything from books by women of color to planet-friendly home goods here. The store is also home to Salt Spray Soap Co., a local artisan skincare line, which has an in-house workshop. \\n Even locals can\\'t resist the charm of the Royal Naval Dockyard Craft Market, where you can find local artisan crafts, jewelry, and souvenirs like cigars, rum cake, prints and paintings, and even rum swizzle mix. Situated on Bermuda\\'s West End, the market is located inside a former warehouse and barrel workshop originally constructed in 1831. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Helmed by chef/owner Jonny Roberts, Bolero\\'s dishes are deceptively simple and surprisingly delicious. The bistro\\'s unassuming entrance down a narrow alley proves looks can be deceiving: it\\'s extremely popular among tourists and locals. Treat yourself to more traditional or vegan tapas, specialty dishes, entrees, and of course, dessert. Outdoor dining is available. \\n Mingle with locals at Devil\\'s Isle, both a specialty coffee shop with take-out options and a dine-in restaurant serving healthy, nutrition-conscious food. Try a slice of their house-made sourdough for breakfast or their house-made pasta for dinner. Outdoor terrace available; reservations welcome. \\n The only traditional Irish pub in Bermuda, Flanagan\\'s serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and has a variety of beers from around the world. Located near the Hamilton Ferry Terminal, it\\'s a popular spot to kick back on the outdoor second-story patio and enjoy the view. Reservations accepted. \\n Home of Bermuda\\'s national cocktail, the rum swizzle, created here in the early 20th century, The Swizzle Inn is Bermuda\\'s oldest pub. (Of course, you can try Bermuda\\'s\\xa0unofficial\\xa0national drink, the dark \\'n\\' stormy, here too.) Laid-back, casual, and rustic, it\\'s a must-stop on any visit to Bermuda. Outdoor seating is available; no reservations required. \\n Located off the beaten path near Hamilton, Art Mel\\'s Spicy Dicy is worth the cab ride if you\\'re seeking a Bermudian meal. It\\'s also (arguably) the best place on the island to try Bermuda\\'s famously unique take on the fish sandwich, which consists of a deep-fried fish filet with tartar sauce on raisin toast. Don\\'t knock it till you\\'ve tried it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Bermuda is in March and April when the weather is temperate and the crowds are less intense. Springtime in Bermuda brings one of the world\\'s most beautiful Good Friday traditions, the Bermuda Kite Festival, which fills the skies over Horseshoe Bay Beach with kites in various colors and styles. \\n Tourist season stretches from May to October when the weather is most balmy and is perfect for those who are looking to hang out on the beach or try some water activities. \"There are amazing sites to free dive or snorkel right from the shore,\" Rachel Sawden, a Bermuda native, free diver, and real estate agent, told T+L. \"Elbow Beach has an amazing shipwreck on its eastern side and a stunning reef and cavern network to the west. On the northeastern side of the island, the rocky coastline of Baileys Bay has lots of nooks and crannies that hold an abundance of life, [including] octopi, squid, and some of the largest parrotfish you’ll ever see.\" \\n If you\\'re planning on visiting from November to February, don\\'t forget to pack a light sweater — the island can get surprisingly chilly in the fall and winter months. \\n January sees Bermuda Restaurant Weeks and the annual\\xa0Bermuda Triangle Challenge Weekend, where adventurous travelers can participate in events ranging from a mile run to a full marathon. In March, the\\xa0Bermuda International Film Festival\\xa0attracts some of the shining stars of the film industry. \\n Harbour Nights is another popular island tradition that begins in April and lasts through early September: on Wednesday nights, the city of Hamilton hosts a pedestrian-only block party with local vendors, artists, activities, and traditional Gombey dancers. Bermuda Carnival takes place each June. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Bermuda \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n You can get to Bermuda by air or by sea. The L.F. Wade International Airport is located on the island\\'s East End and services many major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and JetBlue Airways. This is the fastest and most direct way to reach the island. \\n Bermuda is an excellent cruise destination and has three ports of call you can roll into, including one in the island\\'s capital, the city of Hamilton. Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean Cruises all have itineraries that stop in Bermuda. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Three main regions comprise Bermuda\\'s 21 square miles. \\n East End: Home to the historic town of St. George\\'s, Bermuda\\'s former capital and a UNESCO World Heritage site, the East End is beloved for its history, culture, photo-worthy brick streets, and British colonial architecture. \"You can spend hours wandering through the historic alleys, along the winding coast, and walking the same cobble-stoned streets as iconic figures like pilot Jemmy Darrell, one of Bermuda\\'s first King\\'s pilots and one of the first Black property-owners on the island,\" White told T+L. There are also plenty of natural attractions in addition to the human-made treasures: be sure to check out the limestone formations of Tobacco Bay Beach, Tom Moore\\'s Jungle, the Crystal Caves, Cooper\\'s Island Nature Reserve, and Ferry Reach National Park, home to lush flora and rare birds. \\n Central Bermuda: Hamilton, the island\\'s capital, lies in Central Bermuda and lends the area its more developed, cosmopolitan, and sophisticated global feel. If you\\'re looking for dining, shopping, and nightlife in Bermuda, the island\\'s more commercialized central section is where you\\'ll find it, especially along Front Street downtown. “Visitors can\\'t get enough of the walking tour of Hamilton that allows them to experience Bermuda beyond the beaches, including the marvelous shopping,\" Ed Christopher,\\xa0Bermuda\\'s town crier, told T+L. \"They are able to walk through the vibrant and colorful streets of North Hamilton, embracing Bermuda’s history and changes through the years.\" There are also beaches, botanical gardens, parks, and oceanfront golf. \\n West End: Here, you\\'ll find the Royal Naval Dockyard (home to a major cruise ship port and a craft market, museum, and restaurants) and attractions like the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse, the village of Somerset, and famous South Shore beaches. It\\'s a hub for sightseeing, shopping, dining, and entertainment. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Buses: Pink-and-blue striped buses connect most areas of interest across the island. Bermuda has 11 bus routes and 14 bus zones. A day pass to visit all bus zones costs $19. You can book transportation passes for one to seven consecutive days as well as a month or a three-month pass.

              "  'Lauren Breedlove/Travel + Leisure \\n Big Sur is a 90-mile stretch of coastal California Highway 1 between Carmel-by-the-Sea (to the north) and San Simeon (to the south). The passage usually takes drivers about four hours to complete — although, with so many places to stop for photos, hikes, quirky shops and restaurants you may want to dedicate at least a day to the trip, if not a long weekend. \\n Big Sur is home to breathtaking cliffs, beaches, and seemingly endless trails that snake their way through verdant landscapes, and plenty of hairpin turns that will wrack even the most confident driver\\'s nerves. Our recommendation is to drive north to south because it gives passengers the best view of the Pacific Ocean. However, for the more road-weary drivers, traveling south to north may be preferable. Keep in mind the road is incredibly windy and quite narrow at times. \\n Remember, Big Sur is known for its views, not its cell service, so you may find yourself with little-to-no reception for most of the drive. Plan ahead and enjoy the time being unplugged from the rest of the world. No matter how much time you have to spend in Big Sur, here\\'s how to experience the best of the area. \\n Most travelers experience Big Sur when driving between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The beginning of Big Sur\\'s coastal drive is about 300 miles north of LA. From LA, the best way to get to Big Sur is to make your way up US-101 North to CA-1 North, otherwise known as Highway 1. \\n From San Francisco, you\\'ll drive about 150 miles to Big Sur, taking US-101 South to Highway 1. It\\'s a pleasant drive through places like Salinas and Monterey. Those who prefer to fly are best off flying into Monterey Regional Airport or San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport. \\n Thanks to its position along the coast, Big Sur\\'s weather remains rather temperate year-round, according to BigSurCalifornia.org. \\n While the winters are chilly, they most certainly aren\\'t freezing. The coldest month is February when temperatures dip between 47 degrees Fahrenheit and 58 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Weather Atlas. However, the winters can be a lovely time to come as rainfall fills the streams, making for more scenic hikes. December through April offers the best chance to see gray whales migrating south, according to the Big Sur Chamber of Commerce. \\n In the summer, visitors can expect morning coastal fog that burns off by early afternoon. August marks the hottest month, with an average temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit. With better summer weather comes bigger summer crowds — and more cars making more frequent stops along the route. Spring and fall have their merits, too, thanks to wildflower blooms in the former and colorful foliage in the latter. \\n Big Sur is a perfect destination for the adventurous traveler. There are myriad excellent hiking trails in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, where awe-inspiring views are plentiful. Inside the park, visitors can find towering sycamore and oak trees, along with the ever-popular coastal redwoods that make this park a must-see attraction. \\n Similarly named Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is another beautiful site with plenty of tall trees and a famous 80-foot waterfall that flows directly into the Pacific Ocean below. (You\\'ve probably seen it on Instagram.) The two parks — named after lifetime Big Sur resident Julia Pfeiffer whom the latter of the state parks is dedicated to— are only about 20 minutes apart by car. \\n Big Sur is also home to several stunning beaches; one of the best is Sand Dollar Beach. As the longest stretch of sand in Big Sur, Sand Dollar Beach is a place to spend an entire day exploring the craggy coast, setting up picnics, and daring to take a dip in the cool Pacific waters. \\n A highlight for many Big Sur visitors is a drive across Bixby Creek Bridge. The iconic bridge is only about 30 minutes south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, so it\\'s an excellent way to start or end your trip. The gorgeous span, first built in the 19th century, sits 260 feet above the shoreline. Since its construction, the bridge has become an emblem of the destination — and has even appeared in movies and TV shows, including in the opening credits of HBO\\'s Big Little Lies. \\n For such a small destination, Big Sur comes packed with high-end hotels. Alila Ventana Big Sur is a masterclass in luxury amenities, including a cliffside infinity pool and suites with individual fireplaces. There is even the option to stay in safari-style glamping tents (although glamping guests will not have access to resort amenities). \\n Another glamping option is Treebones Resort, an eco-resort that has a mix of pre-built tents and yurts, along with campsites. There\\'s also the wildly popular \"human nest,\" which is a campsite made out of woven twigs that invites guests to bring a sleeping bag and live like a giant bird for the night. \\n For views that will leave your jaw on the floor, book a stay at the Post Ranch Inn. The individually styled suites and bookable private rooms that sit on the edge of a cliff provide unobstructed views of the horizon. Each of the rooms are crafted using natural materials including wood, glass, and steel. The property also has a tree house — built literally into the trees — that guests can rent complete with a private deck, indoor fireplace, and mini bar. \\n Need more? There\\'s also Glen Oaks Big Sur, a laid-back accommodation made up of cabins, cottages, and a motor lodge. Another option is Deetjen\\'s Big Sur Inn, a historic inn built in 1937 that\\'s listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \\n If starting from the north, kick off your Big Sur trip with phenomenal pastries (and even better coffee) at Big Sur Bakery, located about an hour south of Carmel-by-the-Sea. It\\'s the perfect spot to stock up on fresh baked goods, bread, and other grab-n-go goodies to fuel your day. \\n For more locally sourced goods, stop in at Coast Big Sur, a restaurant serving delectable California fare, including avocado salads and sourdough pizza. Guests can choose to dine in at the rooftop tables or take the food to go (a picnic at Sand Dollar Beach, perhaps?). \\n For dinner, reserve well in advance at Nepenthe, another Big Sur institution. The restaurant, which opened in 1949, offers stellar views of the sea and dazzling sunsets thanks to its position in the Santa Lucia Mountains. Meat eaters should consider the famous Ambrosia Burger, which includes ground steak topped with ambrosia sauce on a soft French roll. There are plenty of vegetarian offerings, as well as seafood choices like the shrimp BLT, seared scallops, and smoked wild salmon. \\n Travelers weary from a day of driving can also stop in at Big Sur Roadhouse, which serves pub staples like beers, burgers, and burritos. If deli choices are more your speed, the Big Sur General Store does massive sandwiches like the avocado-, bacon-, and sprouts-loaded Big Sur Hipster — not to be confused with the Big Sur Hippie, a totally different sandwich, stuffed with roast beef, Sriracha, and horseradish cheddar cheese. \\n',\n",
              "  'Boston is not only one of America\\'s oldest cities, it\\'s also one of the most walkable, and we\\'d even go as far as saying it\\'s one of the easiest to explore. From the Italian roots of the North End to Boston\\'s quintessential brick facades and New England charm, the city has historical and cultural fascination around every corner. First-time visitors wondering what to do in Boston will be thrilled to find that there is an activity to please every kind of traveler—Red Sox games for the sports fans, oysters shucked fresh at the Boston\\'s best restaurants for the foodies, Freedom Trail walking tours for the history buffs, and public green spaces for relaxing in the summertime. \\n Boston is an intimate city, but its cultural breadth makes it feel like a much larger hub. You can feast on some of the country\\'s best dim sum in Chinatown, then walk 15 minutes and be at a brewery by the water. You can go spend an afternoon at a world-renowned art museum and wind up at a Sox game that night, or start your day strolling the Harvard University campus and end the day taking in a concert at the legendary House of Blues. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time (Daylight Savings Time, seasonal. Dates vary) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The best time to visit Boston is from May to November. The late spring and summer months bring beautiful weather (temperatures reach nearly 70 by May and hover in the low 80s by July). Fall in Boston is picturesque, with Harvard University, MIT, and Boston University\\'s campuses trimmed in foliage and temperatures slipping into the low 70s in September and low 60s in October. \\n Visiting in the late spring means catching the Bruins and Celtics close to the playoffs, but you\\'ll want to avoid the graduation weeks in May if at all possible. The summer is lovely in Boston—it\\'s not too hot, and while tourists flock to the city in June, July, and August, the student population clears out. Fall is by no means the off-season, with tourists continuing to arrive and students moving in, but visiting in September and October affords you some of the very best Boston weather. We\\'d recommend avoiding Boston travel from November to April, as these are the coldest, grayest months. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Boston Common is the oldest public park in the United States dating back to 1634. \\n Boston was the first U.S. city to build a subway line, the Tremont Street Subway built in 1897. \\n Another Boston first was Revere Beach, the first public beach in the country. \\n Boston baked beans, New England clam chowder, Boston cream pie, lobster rolls, and Fenway Franks are some of the foods associated with the city. \\n Boston\\'s Beacon Hill neighborhood is one of the city\\'s oldest communities, named for the beacon that once warned locals about invasions. Today it\\'s a protected historic district, and its classic homes can be admired on a self-guided walking tour. \\n The National Park Service manages several of Boston\\'s popular tourist sites. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Public transportation in Boston runs through Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which offers two types of trains: the metro and the commuter rail. There are 13 commuter rail lines, all of which will take you out to various suburbs of the city. There is also a comprehensive metro—which Bostonians call \"the T\"—that runs throughout Boston and can easily bring you to most major attractions and neighborhoods in the city. The T has four lines—the red line, blue line, orange line, and green line—and is generally very easy to navigate. Find the subway map here. \\n You can purchase a CharlieCard, a reusable card to use on MBTA trains and buses. \\n Buses: The MBTA offers a vast number of city buses, all numbered and servicing different areas of the city. They also have Silver Line buses that go to Logan Airport from South Station. \\n Taxis: While taxis are not as abundant here as they are in, say, New York City, it\\'s still simple to grab a cab at Logan Airport or at South Station (a central transportation hub where most buses and trains from other cities arrive). You can also, of course, call in advance for a taxi from a local cab company like Boston Cab Dispatch. \\n Car service: Uber and Lyft are available in Boston, as are black car services like Master Livery. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Boston Harbor Hotel\\n\\n Address: 70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110Phone: (617) 439-7000Book Now \\n The epitome of luxury hospitality in Boston, Boston Harbor Hotel is a five-star property right on the water with 232 rooms and suites.

              "  'Welcome to Brooklyn, home to everything people miss when they visit New York — the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Bridge, and the best hot dogs in the city at Coney Island. Whether you\\'re here for the French press-scented Williamsburg or the quieter life in Park Slope, there\\'s something in Brooklyn for everyone — and that thing is Brooklyn pizza. \\n Historically, Brooklyn has been home to the offbeat and untraditional, from its incredible LGTBQ+ history to the Brooklyn Museum\\'s entire floor dedicated to protest art. It\\'s not built along a grid, inviting travelers to explore as they like through neighborhoods large and small. Brooklyn is also a popular destination for movie and TV buffs, given how frequently it appears in our most beloved media. You can see the police station used in Brooklyn Nine-Nine\\'s exterior shots as you mosey toward Vanderbilt Street for some of Little Cupcake Bakeshop\\'s Brooklyn Blackout Cake, or walk through idyllic Prospect Park and get a good look at the famous carousel. \\n Beautiful and less crowded than Manhattan, Brooklyn deserves as many accolades as the most popular tourist areas across the river. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Year-round. Like the rest of New York, Brooklyn is full of things to do, whether it\\'s the height of summer or the cozy comfort of winter. Some things to keep an eye out for include: \\n The Greenpoint Film Festival, which features four categories of films (documentary, narrative, experimental, and animation) and Q&As with filmmakers, is held every spring (usually May) at the Wythe Hotel on Wythe Avenue. You\\'ll be in the center of all of Greenpoint\\'s best food and fun. \\n Afropunk Fest, known to its fiercest devotees simply as Afropunk, happens every summer from June through August in Fort Greene\\'s Commodore Barry Park. Years past have featured performances from FKA Twigs, Alicia Keys, D\\'Angelo, SZA, and more. Afropunk is also a fashion destination for those with an eye for the freshest, most innovative streetwear. \\n The Brooklyn Book Festival is a fall staple, returning annually for a week in September to thrill book lovers worldwide. It\\'s the largest free literary event in America. Yes, you read that correctly: The entire event is free, talks and signings included. Parties, events, and screenings fill the week leading up to the headline event at Borough Hall in Brooklyn on the final day of the festival. The festival\\'s marketplace is a wonder in and of itself, and well worth a wander to grab special-edition copies of your favorites or snap up brand-new titles. \\n Don\\'t miss ice skating at the LeFrak Center at Lakeside in Prospect Park — this hidden gem boasts two outdoor rinks in the middle of the picturesque park. At $11 for weekend access to the rink and $8 for a skate rental, it\\'s one of the most affordable ways to spend a memorable, classic New York winter day. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Tourism in Brooklyn isn\\'t as big an industry as it is over the river in Manhattan, so hotel deals are easier to snag. If you have a specific neighborhood in mind, it\\'s a good idea to research that area before you go; many neighborhoods have a central hub for public transportation, but are primarily serviced by one or two specific lines. Save yourself the headache by knowing which ones in advance. Brooklyn sidewalks are often narrower than those in Manhattan. It\\'s important to be mindful of the people around you — in groups, try not to take up the entire sidewalk. Native Brooklynites will thank you for it. \\n Currency: U.S. Dollar \\n Language: English \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Trains are accessed by Metrocard in all of New York. Each ride is $2.75, no matter how long you stay on the train. You can purchase Metrocards in most subway stations, and add value (such as $30 flat) or time (such as a week of unlimited rides for a set price). Brooklyn is serviced by almost all of the trains in New York City, but different lines go to different neighborhoods. Central hubs for transfers between lines are at Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center, Jay Street-Metrotech, and Lorimer Street. North Brooklyn is primarily serviced by the L, M, J, and G trains. South Brooklyn is primarily serviced by the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, B, F, D, G, N, Q, and R trains. The G train goes north to south in Brooklyn and does not cross over into Manhattan. It\\'s a good way to move between the two areas. \\n Buses: Brooklyn has extensive bus lines, and buses can be accessed with a regular Metrocard. Buses cost the same as a subway ride, but in Brooklyn, they are sometimes easier ways to get from place to place instead of transferring between trains. All Brooklyn buses start with B — for instance, the B65 is Brooklyn route 65. Bus stops are clearly marked on the sidewalks with what buses stop there and which directions they go. Consult a map or an app such as MyMTA in advance to see if a bus will get you where you need to go more easily than a train. \\n Taxis: Taxis are pea-green in Brooklyn! Green taxis are borough taxis, meaning they can bring you into Manhattan, but their purpose is to bring people in and out of the boroughs other than Manhattan. You can find taxis on any main thoroughfare, such as Atlantic Avenue or Flatbush Avenue. You hail them as you would a taxi in Manhattan, by standing near a place the taxi can easily pull over and holding up your hand. A taxi is empty if the number on its roof is lit, and in service with a customer if that number is dim. \\n Rideshare: Uber and Lyft are always good options in Brooklyn, particularly if you\\'re not in the mood to find a main highway or are far enough away from one that you don\\'t feel like walking. Rides are plentiful and, as always, you can order a private car or join a carpool. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: 60 Furman St., Brooklyn, NY 11201Phone: (347) 696-2500Book Now \\n A tourist favorite for its central location and stunning view of the iconic Manhattan skyline, 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge boasts luxuriously appointed rooms and waterfall showers.

With its combination of towering high-rises and old-Brooklyn charm, DUMBO has a little of everything, and the view can\\'t be beat. \\n Cobble Hill: Scenic and cute, Cobble Hill is a hidden gem of Brooklyn with great coffee and a relaxing atmosphere. Retire here between more crowded destinations for a rejuvenating break in the small local park. Cobble Hill is also a favorite neighborhood for celebs who are somewhat over SoHo, and it features some of the coziest and most chic bars and restaurants in the city. \\n Crown Heights: Home to the Brooklyn Children\\'s Museum and an easy walk from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Crown Heights is the neighborhood to be in for incredible Ethiopian, Sudanese, and Indian food, as well as fantastic nightlife. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Brooklyn, like much of the East Coast, is subject to fickle weather in spring and fall and occasional extremes in winter and summer. Rain is common between March and May and September and November, and temperatures often break 90°F in July and August.

              "  'Elijah-Lovkoff/Getty Images \\n Buenos Aires goes way deeper than its tired \"Paris of South America\\'\\' cliché. Sure, it\\'s got lively sidewalk cafés, a wealth of Belle Époque architecture, and grand leafy avenues leading to flowering urban parks. But Buenos Aires wouldn\\'t be the dynamic capital city it is without the native Argentines and immigrant Portenos who call it home and make it distinctly Buenos Aires. \\n “Buenos Aires’ architecture is a living testament to the blending of European and Latin American influences, creating a stunning urban landscape that never ceases to amaze. However, it\\'s the people of Buenos Aires who truly set it apart. They are welcoming, vivacious, and have an infectious zest for life that is simply contagious,” Mery Calderón, the founder and CEO of Kuoda Travel, a luxury tour operator in South America, told Travel + Leisure. \\n In Buenos Aires, local passions run deep — whether it\\'s for asado, tango, literature, art, or fashion. \\n “From savoring delectable cuisine to immersing yourself in art, history, and exhilarating outdoor activities, Buenos Aires has it all. The delta, a hidden treasure accessible only by boat, holds a magical allure. And of course, the passionate heartbeat of the city is the tango, which pulses through its streets and venues,” said Calderón. \\n Paris could never. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n The Four Seasons Hotel Buenos Aires does the chain proud. The luxury hotel is housed in a Belle Époque mansion surrounded by immaculate gardens and the only outdoor swimming pool in the neighborhood. Sophisticated suites feature stand-alone soaking bathtubs and glass chandeliers. The real action is down at the polo-inspired bar, Pony Line. Oh, and Madonna stays here. \\n Faena Hotel Buenos Aires (or The Faena, as the locals call it) is the most distinct hotel in Buenos Aires. It is located in a converted warehouse, but thanks to top-line interior design by Phillippe Starck, known for his work on the Delano in South Beach and Mondrian in Los Angeles, it has everything you’d expect from a high-end hotel —\\xa0and then some. Expect arabescato marble bathrooms and hand-embroidered throws in rooms that are punched up with red details. The art-centric property even has a giant crown sculpture in the middle of its chic outdoor pool. \\n The old-school luxury of the Alvear Palace Hotel has charmed presidents, Hollywood celebrities, and rock stars since the hotel opened in 1932, and thanks to some recent updates, it continues to wow anyone who has the pleasure of staying there. Expect Hermès bath products, Louis XVI furniture, and Buenos Aires\\' best views from the rooftop bar. Don\\'t miss afternoon tea at L\\'Orangerie with monogrammed teacups and all the edible trimmings. \\n This Neoclassical palace was built in 1934 as a private residence. It wasn’t open to the public until 2006 when it was brought back to life following a major $74 million renovation. \"The hotel really captures the spirit of the city it\\'s in in both historic and modern ways. Not only is the Palacio Duhau an actual historic palace with grand gardens and design, it\\'s also home to a thriving art scene,\" said Elspeth Velten, T+L\\'s general manager, who visited in October 2023. \\n Even after all the work, most of the original building’s details remain, including its distinctive red marble flooring. A second, newly constructed building added more rooms, suites, and amenities, including three restaurants, a bar, lush gardens, an expansive spa, and a private art collection. \\n \"When I visited, a hundred or so hip Porteños celebrated an art opening in the hotel\\'s underground gallery, which during the day also hosts the hotel\\'s buzzing florist. Add a fantastic spa and an impressive plant-based restaurant (in addition to the hotel\\'s more traditional steakhouse) and the Palacio Duhau makes the perfect complement to any time spent in this grand capital city,\" said Velten. \\n Ever imagined what it would be like to live like one of Argentina\\'s coolest artists? Book a room at Home Hotel, a chic, boutique property set in a former private mansion. The vintage 20th-century decor includes Scandinavian design, vintage French wallpaper, and Eero Saarinen furnishings. The outdoor swimming pool is one of the city\\'s best outdoor spaces, with jasmine and fruit trees providing smells and shade. \\n \"During my springtime stay, I couldn\\'t get enough of the hotel\\'s blossoming grounds — we had breakfast outside, drank our coffee in the sun, and even sat poolside on a hot afternoon with a bottle of wine,\" said Velten. \"The hotel\\'s garden vibe extends throughout. Our room had a beautiful view of trailing vines on the building\\'s facade. And every time I entered the mod-designed lobby, I truly did feel like I was coming off the street into someone\\'s home.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Lauren Breedlove/Travel + Leisure \\n Visiting Buenos Aires and not paying homage to Eva Perón’s (Evita) grave in Recoleta Cemetery (Cementerio de la Recoleta) is sacrilegious. Evita aside, wandering through the above-ground tombs and religious symbols in this National Historic Landmark is a memorable experience. \\n OK, so a tango show is touristy. But the Rojo Tango Show inside the sexy Faena Hotel is touristy done right. It\\'s intimate, and fun, and might inspire a tango lesson or trip to a local milonga. The entertainment is paired with a multi-course meal that includes braised Patagonian lamb and tres leches. Free drinks include Champagne and wine. \\n Elspeth Velten/Travel + Leisure \\n Strolling down the historical and colorful Caminito (“little path,” in Spanish) is like visiting an outdoor art gallery. If tango dancers and bargain souvenirs hawkers frequented art galleries. Colorfully painted houses edge the walkway, which is busy with artists selling their wares and tango and folk dance performances. \\n If you\\'re a soccer (fútbol) fan, then La Bombonera is a church. If you manage to visit during the fútbol season, you can catch a Boca Juniors match. If not, take a tour and visit the stadium’s dedicated museum, which showcases the club’s history and is located under the grandstand. \\n If you have to pick one museum to see in Buenos Aires, MALBA is it. The modern building is known for its permanent collection of famed contemporary Latin American artists. Check out works by Frida Kahlo, Fernando Botero, and Antonio Berni. Talented curators also highlight local artists for seasonal exhibits. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n This shop-filled building brings designers and artists together in one of the hippest art and design spaces in Buenos Aires. The shops sell everything from basic clothing to vintage and one-of-a-kind artist-made finds. There’s a cute patio cafe for cafe chicos and an ongoing calendar of events and workshops that draw the city’s hip, artist crowd. \\n This labyrinth of a boutique has specialized in early- and mid-century vintage clothing and homewares since it opened shop in Buenos Aires in 1973. Gil Antiguedades is a collector’s dream, with everything from antique beaded necklaces and lace wedding gowns to rare vintage crystal and one-of-a-kind textiles. \\n After years of working in the Paris fashion industry for brands like Golden Goose, Hermès, and Isabel Marant, María Abdala Zolezzi (nicknamed “Maydi”) returned to her native Argentina and launched her own label. Maydi is a sustainable, high-fashion knitwear label that uses native materials and dyes. The selection of knitwear —\\xa0for both men and women — is wearable art at its best. \\n This perfumery, also known as Fueguia 1833 Patagonia, is a true Argentinian sensory experience. The lovely melody of smell found at Fueguia 1833 was inspired by founder Julian Bedel\\'s travels throughout Patagonia and is a tribute to the Indigenous communities of South America. Pro tip: the handcrafted candles make perfect gifts. \\n Elspeth Velten/Travel + Leisure \\n Buenos Aires has a serious literary scene. Celebrate it at El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a bookstore housed in a grand theater that was built in 1919. The enormous space is now packed floor-to-ceiling with books and ornate original fixtures. The former stage now houses a cafe. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Sarkis is a family-style Armenian restaurant that\\'s the perfect place to start a night out. Small plates of succulent lamb, marinated eggplant, and flaky nut pastries arrive willy-nilly, adding to the eatery’s distinct charm. The wandering belly dancers and coffee ground readers are a good distraction between courses and real Armenian coffee will keep you awake until the discotheque closes. \\n La Cocina restaurant is tucked inside Casa Cavia, a high-end retail and restaurant concept in Palermo. In keeping with the creative vibes, La Cocina has an incredibly diverse and artistic seasonal food and cocktail menu. The interior alone is reason enough to visit. Inspired by 1920s cafes, it features white marble, brass, and antique mirrors — while still staying fresh and airy. If you can\\'t get a dinner reservation, a breakfast of dulce de leche baked goods is almost as good. \\n There are lots of reasons why La Cabrera is considered to be one of the best steakhouses in the world — and great steak is just one of them. The asador (master griller) working a firebox filled with red-hot embers and racks of meat is another. And then there’s the fact that La Cabrera is overflowing with atmosphere. \\n Calderón calls La Cabrera “a long-standing Argentinian steakhouse known for its perfectly seasoned rosemary-flavored steaks. Complemented by an array of delectable side dishes, La Cabrera has garnered a well-deserved reputation among Palermo residents.” \\n Don\\'t leave Buenos Aires without trying empanadas. Though hand-held street food is everywhere, finding empanadas with good dough texture and perfectly seasoned fillings can be a challenge. El Banco Rojo delivers both, along with a Buenos Aires-renowned menu of burgers and tacos. Pair your empanada of choice with a bottle of Rubia craft beer. This is a hip, counter-service spot with a picnic table and stool seating. \\n If you want a glamorous night out in Recoleta, Presidente Bar is your spot. Every detail is carefully thought out, from the music and lighting to the staff — it\\'s all on point. The glowing back-lit bar, high ceilings, and hanging chandelier evoke a classic era that adds to the bar’s old-world charm. The menu includes everything from calamari and empanadas to risotto and the Hamburguesa Presidente. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Buenos Aires is spring and fall —\\xa0just remember that spring in the Southern Hemisphere falls between September and December and fall is between April and June. \\n “Spring, without a doubt, is my favorite season in Buenos Aires,” confirmed Calderón. “As the city awakens from its slumber, it transforms into a lush oasis. The jacaranda trees burst into bloom, painting the streets with their enchanting violet blossoms, creating an atmosphere of pure magic. Spring gifts Buenos Aires the perfect weather — sunny days and the intoxicating scent of blossoms in the air.” \\n Spring and fall may offer visitors mild temperatures, blooms, and thinner crowds, but Buenos Aires is a lively metropolis with something to see and do all year round. \\n The league fútbol season for the Primera División, the country\\'s premier level, runs from late January until early August, and Argentina\\'s La Triple Corona, a polo triple crown, runs from late September until early December. The city also hosts an international tango festival in mid-August. \\n Keep in mind that travel might be tricky during Semana Santa, the Holy Week of Easter when Argentina all but shuts down while residents travel to visit family and attend religious services. \\n nickalbi/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Buenos Aires is serviced by three airports: Ministro Pistarini International Airport, Ezeiza (EZE); Jorge Newbery Airport, known as Aeroparque (AEP); and El Palomar (EPA). \\n EZE is the biggest and most used airport, especially for travelers coming from the U.S., as there are plenty of direct flights between the U.S. and Buenos Aires. And from the EZE airport, it\\'s around 20 miles (roughly 50 minutes) to the center of the city. \\n The closest airport to central Buenos Aires is AEP, but most flights are to and from neighboring South American countries or other airports within Argentina. The same goes for EPA, which typically welcomes low-cost domestic flights. \\n FrankvandenBergh/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Palermo is top of the neighborhood-to-see list for most visitors. It has plenty of offerings that will make even the most Americanized visitor feel at home, and there are plenty of shady parks and tree-lined walking paths. According to Calderón, “Palermo buzzes with life, boasting an abundance of bars, restaurants, museums, parks, and picturesque streets to explore. It\\'s where you\\'ll find the pulse of the city.” \\n Elspeth Velten/Travel + Leisure \\n This neighborhood has a high-end feel, with luxury hotels and glamorous bars, but it also acts as a cultural center for Buenos Aires, with ongoing concerts, art exhibitions, and popular local haunts. Calderón confirms that Recoleta “exudes elegance and offers a glimpse into Buenos Aires\\' architectural grandeur.” \\n If you’re looking for nightlife and a hip, up-and-coming vibe, Villa Crespo is your spot. This neighborhood, which surrounds a former shoe factory, has a great selection of cafes and bars. \\n Elspeth Velten/Travel + Leisure \\n This neighborhood is best known for its bohemian vibe, which is complemented with street murals and ongoing pop-up art galleries. The San Telmo Market, a large indoor market that opened in 1897 to serve the area’s immigrant populations, is a must. \\n Fandrade/Getty Images \\n This colorful neighborhood is best known for its popular art walk, the aforementioned Caminito. But in reality, La Boca is an art mecca, with spaces like Usina del Arte, a cultural center located in an old power plant. If you want to avoid the tourist mayhem on Caminito, check out Calle Suarez or Pinzon. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n If you’re planning to stay in the city, there’s no need to rent a car. The city is walkable and there’s a great city-bike system, BA Ecobici, which has over 3,000 bicycles spread throughout the city. \\n Subway: Buenos Aires also has a dependable and well-used subway system called Subte. Six lines connect commercial, tourist, and residential areas throughout Buenos Aires, with trains running every three to 10 minutes, depending on the line. To travel by Subte (or bus) in Buenos Aires, you\\'ll need to get a rechargeable SUBE card. For schedules, routes, and live updates, download the transpo app, BA Cómo Llego.Train: For transportation with a tourist twist, Calderón recommends “Tren de la Costa, a picturesque train journey that takes you on a captivating ride through the charming suburbs of Buenos Aires, particularly in Zona Norte.” \\n Taxi: You’ll find over 40,000 licensed taxis and plenty of Ubers waiting to take you to your destination any time of day (or night). Calderón also recommends trying out Cabify, a Latin American rideshare app that operates in Buenos Aires. \\n',\n",
              "  'No matter how many times you visit Cape Cod, you\\'ll continue to find new ways to be captivated by its beauty. Massachusetts\\' hook-shaped peninsula is special in so many ways, thanks to its abundance of charming towns and sandy, pitch-pine-dotted landscapes. In Chatham, for example, a lively Main Street beckons shoppers and diners. But further north, the towns of Wellfleet and Truro have a more laid-back vibe with quiet beaches and winding back roads. Provincetown — the crown jewel at the very tip of the Cape — is a haven for painters, photographers, and writers. \\n Just about every town on Cape Cod can lay claim to some of New England\\'s most idyllic vacation rentals and bed-and-breakfasts — not to mention award-winning seafood shacks and restaurants. There\\'s also the unspoiled beauty of the Cape Cod National Seashore, where seemingly endless stretches of sand invite you to sunbathe, hike, and sunbathe some more. And the Cape\\'s countless other beaches are all treasures on their own, from Nauset Light Beach in Eastham to Mayflower Beach in Dennis. \\n A haven for those of us drawn to the sea, Cape Cod brims with nautical charm like no other. It\\'s true: Nothing beats Cape Cod beaches or Cape Cod lighthouses, but in all honesty, we could do without the Cape Cod traffic. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n While the height of summer (between June and late August) is the quintessential time to experience Cape Cod, it\\'s a treat to visit in September and October, when the crowds have subsided. Prices tend to be lower in the fall, too. Don\\'t miss the Provincetown Film Festival in June and Wellfleet OysterFest in October. Find flights here. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n The Cape is famous for its traffic, and it has two bridges to thank for that: the Bourne Bridge and the Sagamore Bridge. They\\'re the only entry and exit roads onto the hook-shaped chunk of land, and they almost always create a bottleneck effect on weekends in the summer. \\n Your best bet is to begin (and end) your stay on a weekday. If you absolutely must drive in or out on a weekend, expect to add over an hour to your driving time. (For reference, it takes about an hour and a half to drive from Provincetown to Bourne.) Visit Cape Cod Commission for real-time traffic updates. \\n Temperatures, much like traffic, vary wildly on the Cape. It\\'s cooler than you might guess during summertime (thank you, sea breezes), and the ocean tends to hover around 67 degrees at the height of the season. It\\'s also fairly mild in the winter — the salt air tends to minimize huge snowstorms. A word to the wise? Always bring a light jacket, no matter what the weatherman says, and keep a pair of flip-flops handy for spontaneous beach excursions. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Google Maps might tell you Cape Cod is a little over an hour\\'s drive from Boston, but in this case, the app is wrong. There\\'s constantly bumper-to-bumper traffic in the summertime, especially on weekends. So, if you\\'re driving, factor in another hour into your travel time to be safe. \\n There\\'s the option to catch a short flight from Boston or Providence into Hyannis or Provincetown. You can also take a seasonal train called the CapeFlyer, which departs from Boston\\'s South Station on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Tickets start at $22 one-way and $40 round-trip, and cover a two-hour scenic ride into Hyannis. (As an added bonus, kids 11 and under ride free when accompanied by a paying adult.) \\n The most fun way to get there is the fast ferry from Boston. Bay State Cruise Company and Boston Harbor Cruises offer 90-minute rides across the bay, where you can sip a cold beer from the onboard bar. Tickets start at $61 one-way or $93 round-trip. Once you arrive, you\\'ll need to rent a car to see everything. There is a public bus system, but it doesn\\'t reach every corner of the Cape (or every beach). It\\'s most useful to travelers staying put in one or two towns, or for short trips. A CharlieCard, the form of payment used on Boston\\'s subway system, is accepted on Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority buses. \\n Trains: CapeFlyer, capeflyer.com \\n Buses: Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority, capecodtransit.org \\n Taxis: Town Taxi of Cape Cod, towntaxicapecod.com, Cape Cab, capecabtaxi.com \\n Rideshare: Uber, uber.com Lyft, lyft.com \\n Boats: Bay State Cruise Company, baystatecruisecompany.com, Boston Harbor Cruises, bostonharborcruises.com \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Eben House\\n\\n Address: 90 Bradford St., Provincetown, MA 02657Phone: (508) 487-0386Book Now \\n Eben House, one of Provincetown\\'s premier boutique hotels, harbors a whole lot of history.

Its menu sits at the crossroads of French and Italian, and sources its ingredients from Cape Cod and greater New England. For a late afternoon pick-me-up, pull up a seat at one of the bar\\'s yellow stools and tuck into a swordfish kebab or corned beef slider. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sesuit Harbor Cafe, Dennis\\n\\n Address: 357 Sesuit Neck Rd., Dennis, MA 02638Phone: (508) 385-6134Website \\n One of the best raw bars on the Cape is inside a no-frills, buoy-clad shack on the shores of Sesuit Harbor. Order oysters, steamers, and mussels from the bar, then grab a lobster roll — the kind that\\'s lovingly placed in those red-and-white paper boats — from the main restaurant. Enjoy it all at a picnic table overlooking Dennis\\' Northside Marina on one side, and Cape Cod bay to the other. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Cape Cod National Seashore\\n\\n Address: 99 Marconi Site Rd., Wellfleet, MA 02667Website \\n Head to the Outer Cape to glimpse the sandy stretches of the Cape Cod National Seashore, a preserved swath of coastline established by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. The seashore\\'s visitor center in Eastham offers a comprehensive overview of the area, and connects to several hiking trails. The crown jewel of hiking on the Cape, however, is the Great Island Trail, a nearly seven-mile hike along the National Seashore in Wellfleet. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Monomoy Island Seal Cruise\\n\\n Website \\n Jutting out into the Atlantic from Chatham, Monomoy Island is home to a National Wildlife Refuge, where migratory birds nest and seals linger on both land and sea. A Monomoy Island Seal Cruise showcases the area\\'s wildlife — board a catamaran-style boat to see hundreds of harbor and grey seals swimming in waters near historic lighthouses. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sandwich Glass Museum\\n\\n Address: 129 Main St., Sandwich, MA 02563Phone: (508) 888-0251Website \\n The town of Sandwich, Massachusetts, was once a hub for the American glass industry. From candlesticks and tableware to toys and lamps, companies like Boston & Sandwich Glass Factory and Cape Cod Glass Works churned out both intricately detailed and purely utilitarian pieces during the early 1800s. The Sandwich Glass Museum chronicles the history of the glass industry on the Cape, showcasing the company\\'s classic designs and hundreds of other colorful treasures. Live glass-blowing demonstrations round out a sparkling visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Highland Light\\n\\n Address: 27 Highland Light Rd., North Truro, MA 02652Website \\n Did you really visit Cape Cod if you didn\\'t climb to the top of an active lighthouse? Perched on the coast of Truro, Highland Lighthouse was commissioned by George Washington and erected in 1797 as the 20th light station in the newly formed United States. When the lighthouse isn\\'t undergoing structural repairs, visitors can mount all 69 twisting, turning steps to the top for sweeping views of the ocean. (Tours of the lighthouse are suspended through 2021, but the grounds are open, so you can take in those views.) Nearby, the Highland House Museum, once a hotel, presents the history of Truro\\'s earliest European settlers. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Provincetown Art Association and Museum\\n\\n Address: 460 Commercial St., Provincetown, MA 02657Phone: (508) 487-1750Website \\n Provincetown is a haven for artists, so it\\'s no wonder its art museum is a treat for the eyes. Much of the museum\\'s collection represents artists from the Outer Cape, including the likes of Ross Moffett, Blanche Lazzell, and Robert Motherwell. Keep an eye out for exhibit openings — they\\'re free and open to the public. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Pilgrim Monument\\n\\n Address: 1 High Pole Hill Rd., Provincetown, MA 02657Website \\n Built in 1910 to commemorate the landing of the Pilgrims in Provincetown, the Pilgrim Monument is the town\\'s most recognizable landmark. The views atop it are unparalleled, displaying the dramatic curve of the Cape. The catch? It\\'s a bit of a workout to get there. After a spin through the monument\\'s history museum, climb the tower\\'s 116 steps to reach the top. It\\'s not so hard to catch your breath when you\\'re overlooking the Atlantic. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cape Cod Rail Trail\\n\\n Website \\n This 22-mile-long bike trail traverses a huge section of the Cape. From Dennis all the way to Wellfleet, the trail meanders past kettle ponds and cranberry bogs, through a state park, and up to the National Seashore. Rent a bike in one of the towns along the trail, and trace a part (or all) of it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Whydah Pirate Museum\\n\\n Address: 674 MA-28, West Yarmouth, MA 02673Phone: (508) 534-9571Website \\n The Whydah Pirate Museum is not Cape Cod\\'s only pirate museum, but it is its newest. Opened in 2016 in West Yarmouth, the building off of Route 28 contains a true-to-size model of the Whydah Gally, a pirate ship that sank off the coast of Wellfleet in the 1700s. Learn all about the artifacts recovered from the ship and the adventures of the museum\\'s owner, Barry Clifford, who unearthed the wreck in 1984. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Commercial Street, Provincetown\\n\\n Commercial Street is Provincetown\\'s main thoroughfare, lined with adorable shops, boutiques, and art galleries. From Marine Specialties, a quirky surplus store, to Packard Gallery, one of the Cape\\'s most famous art galleries, there\\'s plenty to browse at a range of price points. You could pop into the stores along the road that catch your eye, then sit down for a classic lobster dinner at the Lobster Pot. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Downtown Chatham\\n\\n The downtown area of Chatham appeals to upscale shoppers. Brands like Lilly Pulitzer, FatFace, and Jack Wills have set up along Main Street, but the road is mainly populated with locally owned spots. Boutiques like Mayflower Shop sell playful home goods in a centuries-old building, while Chatham Candy Manor doles out some of the most delectable fudge around. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Wicked Thrift & PopRock Vintage\\n\\n Address: 1094 MA-28, South Yarmouth, MA 02664Phone: (508) 648-5902Website \\n Love shopping vintage?

The South Yarmouth store sells both vintage and modern clothing for men and women, and is chock-full of one-of-a-kind accessories. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Downtown Hyannis\\n\\n Strolling Main Street Hyannis can feel like stepping back in time. Lined with ice cream shops, candy stores, and some standby T-shirt emporiums, it\\'s a family-friendly spot to bring the kids. If you stop for a ride on Wackenhammer\\'s carousel, browse the Cape Cod bracelets at Cape Cod Jewelers, and grab a handful of penny candy at the Kandy Korner, you\\'ve checked off the boxes for a perfect Hyannis detour. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cuffy\\'s\\n\\n Address: Multiple LocationsWebsite \\n Cuffy\\'s is Cape Cod\\'s most iconic outfitter. You might recognize their apparel — it\\'s the wholesome shop that sells those classic pastel-colored sweatshirts with \"Cape Cod\" emblazoned on the front. With four locations across the Cape, it\\'s hard not to stop in — and too easy to walk out with a hoodie or three. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Towns to Know\\n\\n Provincetown: Provincetown (better known as P-town) is quirky, quaint, and a lot of fun when the sun goes down. Situated at the very tip of the Cape, its population swells with artists — and plenty of talented drag queens — in the summertime. Spend the morning soaking up the sun at Race Point Beach, then explore all Commercial Street has to offer. \\n Wellfleet: Wellfleet shows off a sleepier side of the Cape, as gray-shingled cottages and old captains\\' houses dot leafy back roads. It\\'s one of the towns that makes up the Cape Cod National Seashore, where wide-open stretches of sand blend into the Atlantic. \\n Chatham: As one of the Cape\\'s tonier towns, Chatham has a lot to offer. Visitors here will find great shopping, luxurious hotels, and some of the area\\'s most pristine beaches. \\n Hyannis: Hyannis is a major transportation hub for the Cape, as both trains and buses end their journeys from Boston here. Stopping to stroll down Main Street makes for an afternoon well spent. \\n Dennis: This single town boasts a whopping 16 beaches, thanks to coastlines on both its northern and southern borders. Eight of them are situated along the ocean side, while the other eight offer a calmer experience by the bay. \\n Falmouth: Tucked at Cape Cod\\'s eastern end, the charming town of Falmouth sits across the sound from Martha\\'s Vineyard. It\\'s a good option for a weekend trip from elsewhere in New England, as it\\'s not too far up the arm of the Cape. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Flocks of beachgoers descend upon Cape Cod between June and August. July is the peninsula\\'s hottest month, with an average high of 78°F (25°C). Come wintertime, most towns are quiet. Snow is somewhat rare, thanks to salty sea air and more mild temperatures, but it\\'s wise to be prepared anyway. January and December are the Cape\\'s coldest months, with an average high of 40°F (4°C). \\n Average temperatures according to the U.S. Weather Bureau are as follows: \\n January: 25°F to 40°FFebruary: 26°F to 41°FMarch: 28°F to 42°FApril: 40°F to 53°FMay: 48°F to 62°FJune: 56°F to 71°FJuly: 63°F to 78°FAugust: 62°F to 76°FSeptember: 56°F to 70°FOctober: 57°F to 59°FNovember: 37°F to 49°FDecember: 26°F to 40°F \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Sharktivity: The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\\'s map of sightingsiOS | Android \\n MBTA mTicket: Where to buy CapeFlyer train tickets virtuallyiOS | Android \\n Chimani: A National Parks app to help you discover the Cape Cod National SeashoreiOS | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'Cape Town is South Africa\\'s crown jewel and the most European city you\\'ll find on the continent. Founded by the Dutch East India Company in 1652, it was South Africa\\'s first attempt at a modern metropolis, earning it the nickname \"The Mother City.\" Because of its strategic location at the southwestern tip of Africa, for centuries it played an important role in global trade. Today it\\'s one of South Africa\\'s three capital cities. The metro area covers 950 square miles and is home to 3.5 million people. The city\\'s setting, a dramatic coastline in the shadow of Table Mountain National Park, is as picturesque as its history is problematic. Like the rest of South Africa, Cape Town is still trying to recover from the apartheid era which ended in 1994. While crime and corruption are still issues, in 2010 the city helped host the FIFA World Cup and tourism has only grown since then. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n GMT +2 \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Cape Town is worth visiting year-round. That said, it looks different each season. Late December through March is South Africa\\'s summer. It\\'s when Cape Town is alive with tourists escaping their own winters back home and locals enjoying the gorgeous weather. It\\'s sunny, dry, and warm enough to warrant a dip in the ocean. The city\\'s social calendar is packed with events, and while prices might be higher during this peak season, at least everything is open. If you\\'re looking for lower prices and fewer people, visit during the winter, late June through late September. Pack a raincoat because winter means wet. If your goal is to see whales, check out the Hermanus Whale Festival usually held in late September. However, July and August are also considered great months for whale watching. Finally, the shoulder seasons can be just as unforgettable. Spring, September through early December, is when the wildflowers are in full bloom. Autumn, late March through early June, is thought to be the best time to go cage diving with great white sharks. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Rand (ZAR)($1 USD = 14.27 ZAR; Check the current exchange rate) \\n Tipping: Tipping is greatly appreciated in Cape Town. If the service is good, 10% is customary. Sometimes gratuity is added at restaurants, especially for groups, so check your bill before accidentally tipping twice. \\n Language: Most sources say there are 11 official languages in South Africa (some say 12). Xhosa, English, and Afrikaans are among the most spoken. That said, most people speak English, and all signs in Cape Town are in English. There\\'s no need for Google Translate. However, it can be helpful to know a few common terms. \\n Lekker: great or nice; \"That was a lekker surf session.\" \\n Braai: outdoor barbecue; \"If you\\'re lucky, locals will invite you to their weekend braai.\" \\n Bru: friend/pal; \"My bru works at a winery in Stellenbosch.\" \\n Calling Code: +27 21 \\n Outlets: South Africa uses type C,D,M, and N plugs. Pack an adapter or be prepared to buy one in Cape Town. The voltage is 230V and standard frequency is 50Hz. So, you may also need to buy a converter if you\\'re using an appliance requiring more voltage. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Cape Town\\'s trains exist as the Metrorail, but they\\'re not particularly reliable. If you ask locals, they can also be unsafe. It\\'s not recommended to ride them alone, especially at night. If you do want to take one, the most popular line is the South line running to Simon\\'s Town. Tickets can be purchased at stations or from Metrorail officials with portable ticket machines. \\n Buses: While there are several local buses and minibuses, basically vans shuttling commuters, the best buses for visitors are the MyCiTi buses. They connect with the airport and serve scheduled stops in high traffic tourist areas. Fares are loaded onto myconnect cards which can be purchased at station kiosks and select retailers and ATMs. Another option is the City Sightseeing Bus. These Hop-On-Hop-Off buses also make scheduled stops at popular tourist destinations and include commentary in 15 languages. The Red Line covers the northern part of Cape Town, and the Blue Line goes all the way to Hout Bay in the south. Tickets can be purchased online. \\n Taxis/Rideshare: Ubers are everywhere in Cape Town. They\\'re reliable, safe and extremely affordable. A 45-minute Uber from downtown Cape Town to a Muizenberg can cost as little as $12. They also service the airport. If you don\\'t have Uber and want to use a traditional taxi, try to use a call ahead car service that is verified. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: 12 Apostles Hotel and Spa\\n\\n Address: Victoria Road, Camps BayPhone: +27 21 4379000Website \\n It\\'s hard not to miss this five-star oceanfront property because it\\'s the only building on its stretch of the scenic drive to Chapman\\'s Peak. Each of its 70 rooms has either a sweeping view of the 12 Apostles mountain range or the Atlantic Ocean where it\\'s not uncommon to see seals sunning themselves or whales breaching. Between the adjoining spa and the food and drinks served in the fabled Leopard Bar, guests never even have to venture into town. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The President Hotel Cape Town\\n\\n Address: 4 Alexander Rd, Bantry BayPhone: +27 21 434 8111Website \\n This esteemed four-star hotel in the quiet residential community of Bantry Bay is just blocks from the beach.

But they\\'re so well-appointed they even feature pillow menus. The property is located along Sunset Beach (with exclusive beach access), 15 minutes north of Cape Town but close enough to have impressive Table Mountain views. Facilities include private viewing decks, a solar-heated pool and splash pad, and a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \\n \\n\\nHeading: La Rose Bed & Breakfast\\n\\n Address: 32 Rose St, Schotsche KloofPhone: +27 21 422 5883Website \\n The hearts and brains behind this budget-friendly retreat belong to the husband and wife team of Adheera Bodasing, a South African of Indian descent, and Yoann Nicolas, a Frenchman who fell in love with South Africa in his 20s. Each of the nine rooms is unique, paying homage to different cultures via art and décor collected by the couple on their travels. The property is located in the eclectic Bo-Kaap, formerly the Cape Malay quarters, neighborhood. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Mojo Market (food court with local pop-ups)\\n\\n Address: 30 Regent Road, Sea Point, Cape Town, 8060Phone: +27 21 422 4888Website \\n Open seven days a week, Mojo Market is Sea Point\\'s trendy indoor market where diners can find more than 15 local food stalls and \"traders.\" Choose from fresh mussels, artisanal pizza, build-your-own burritos, sushi, and even Cape Town\\'s only macaroni and cheese joint. While there\\'s live music every night and plenty of TVs, the best entertainment here is people watching. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Mzansi Restaurant (African)\\n\\n Address: 45 Harlem Ave, Langa, Cape Town, 7455Phone: +27 73 754 8502Website \\n Reservations are definitely required at this popular African restaurant ranked #1 on TripAdvisor out of nearly 1,000 restaurants in Cape Town Central. Food is served buffet style with signature dishes being flavorful plays on traditional Xhosa meals. While the restaurant serves specialities like chicken feet and sheep\\'s head (upon request), it\\'s also vegetarian-friendly. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Die Strandloper (seafood)\\n\\n Address: Jan Olfsen Str, Leentjiesklip, Langebaan, 7357Phone: +27 22 77 22 490Website \\n Family-owned and operated, Die Strandloper is famous in Cape Town for its 10-course seafood lunch or dinner served on the beach. Allow for at least three hours to enjoy everything from smoked angelfish to barbecued mackerel and even kreef, South Africa\\'s spiny lobster. Reservations are required. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Wine Studio (wine pairings)\\n\\n Address: Dock Rd, Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town, 8001Phone: +27 21 431 4511Website \\n Brand new as of 2021, the One&Only\\'s Wine Studio showcases the property\\'s award-winning wine collection in a unique reverse pairing experience. Head sommelier Luvo Ntezo hosts these exclusive private dinners featuring rare vintages, special guests from local wineries, and even the opportunity to create your own signature blend. Reservations are required. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Café Caprice (contemporary café)\\n\\n Address: 37 Victoria Road, Camps Bay, Cape Town, 8005Phone: +27 21 438 8315Website \\n Ask a dozen locals where the best place to sip a cocktail and watch the sunset in Cape Town is and at least half will mention Café Caprice. Open seven days a week, the café serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It\\'s also the best place to see and be seen in Camps Bay, so dress to impress or at the very least, be impressed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Kauai (healthy fast food)\\n\\n Multiple locations throughout Cape TownWebsite \\n Cape Town\\'s best fast food option is this beloved South African chain serving fresh wraps, salads, omelettes, and smoothies. Ingredients are what you\\'d expect to find at a pricey health food store, still it\\'s easy to get a filling meal for $5. There are several locations throughout Cape Town, and they\\'re open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Surf at Muizenberg\\n\\n Address: Beach Rd., Cape Town, 7950Phone: +27 82 412 8781Website \\n The ocean around Cape Town is cold, but it\\'s also home to one of the best beaches in the world to learn how to surf. Muizenberg, a surfing community about 40 minutes from Cape Town, is famous for its historic colorful changing houses. It also boasts great beginner waves all day every day. While there are a number of surf schools in Muizenberg, if you\\'re staying in Cape Town it\\'s worth it to go with a mobile school like Stoked Surf School which includes roundtrip transportation. \\n \\n\\nHeading: See the penguins at Boulder Beach\\n\\n Address: Kleintuin Road, Sea Forth, Simons Town, 7975Phone: +27 21 786 2329Website \\n Billed as the only place where you can get close to African penguins in the wild, Boulder Beach is a must if you find yourself on the False Bay side of Cape Town. For a small entrance fee, visitors can observe the comings and goings of the colony who live on this white sand beach named for its truck-sized boulders. It\\'s also possible to swim with the penguins, but be forewarned; the water is frigid. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hike in Table Mountain National Park\\n\\n Address: 5821 Tafelberg Rd., Table Mountain, Cape Town, 8001Phone: +27 21 424 8181 (aerial cableway)Website \\n Table Mountain is South Africa\\'s most famous landmark and the namesake for this sprawling national park stretching from the city all the way down the cape peninsula to include the southernmost point of Africa. In addition to striking geological formations, it\\'s home to incredible bio-diversity including distinct vegetation not found anywhere else in the world. Hike one of many trails to the top of Table Mountain (3,563 ft.) or ride the cable car to the top where even more trails converge and offer panoramic views for miles. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Visit Robben Island\\n\\n Address: Private Bag Robben Island, Cape Town, 7400Phone: +27 21 413 4200Website \\n Located in Table Bay, visible from almost anywhere in Cape Town, Robben Island looms in the background much like Alcatraz in San Francisco. But this infamous island has 400 years of its own fascinating history. Once occupied by wildlife and indigenous peoples, it was important for trade and hunting during the Age of Exploration before later becoming home to everything from banished convicts to a whaling station and even an insane asylum. Today, it\\'s where visitors can tour the former prison and see the cell where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. Other attractions on the island include a penguin sanctuary and lepers\\' graveyard. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Visit the Cape Winelands\\n\\n Jess Macdonald/Travel + Leisure \\n Address: Stellanbosch, Franschhoek, and PaarlWebsite \\n There are hundreds of wine farms growing grapes in Cape Town\\'s fertile backyard known as the Winelands. Most are within an hour\\'s drive of the city and are open to the public for tastings and tours. This region, one of the oldest wine regions outside of Europe, is famous for its Pinotage, a bold red wine birthed in South Africa. Even if you don\\'t drink alcohol, it\\'s a scenic drive through pastoral communities including Stellenbosch, a 350-year-old university town filled with Cape Dutch architecture. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: V&A Waterfront\\n\\n Address: 19 Dock Rd, Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town, 8001Phone: +27 21 408 7600Website \\n A destination in itself, the V&A Waterfont is home to an indoor and outdoor mall featuring more than 450 retail stores. Whether you\\'re looking for Adidas, Armani, or Crocs, Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre probably has it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Kalk Bay\\n\\n Address: Main Road, Kalk Bay, Cape Town, 7990Website \\n This quiet former fishing village turned popular day trip is about a 45-minute drive from Cape Town, but it\\'s worth it if you\\'re into eclectic shops you won\\'t find elsewhere. Spend the afternoon browsing in independent bookstores or hunting for antiques. Most shops can be found on Main Road, but you never know what treasure awaits in an alley in Kalk Bay. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Greenmarket Square\\n\\n Address: Burg St &, Longmarket St, Cape Town City Centre, Cape Town, 8000Website \\n Since 1696 when the cobblestones were laid Greenmarket Square has been a popular meeting space. Today, it\\'s where locals and visitors alike barter with vendors who set up shops—from formal stalls to makeshift tables—filled with home goods and African arts and handicrafts. It\\'s open every day, but the first Thursday of every month during Cape Town\\'s city-wide First Thursdays celebrations is the best time to catch live music and street performances. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighbourgoods Market\\n\\n Address: 373 Albert Rd, Woodstock, Cape Town, 7925Website \\n A beautifully restored old biscuit mill couldn\\'t be a more perfect setting for this farmers market open every Saturday. This is where shoppers find souvenirs that aren\\'t mass produced. They\\'re made by entrepreneurial locals selling everything from leather bags to soaps and sustainable fashions. Of course, there\\'s also fresh seasonal produce and delicious street food. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n City Bowl: Nestled in a natural depression between the coast, Table Mountain and Signal Hill, City Bowl is the heart of Cape Town. It\\'s home to the central business district, impressive municipal buildings, and several of Cape Town\\'s oldest and most Insta-worthy streets. There\\'s the well-preserved Dutch colonial architecture on Long Street, the colored houses lining the hills of the Bo-Kaap, and the V&A where you can paddleboard on canals winding through the bustling waterfront district. \\n Cape Flats: Although most tourists never step foot here, it would be remiss not to mention the Cape Flats. This lowland area is home to Cape Town\\'s most infamous suburbs or townships. It\\'s where the black and colored populations were forced to relocate during the Apartheid years. Although it\\'s a bit off-the-beaten tourist path, it is possible to visit the townships with a guide and learn about life in them with the locals. Most visitors start with a walking tour of Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay. \\n Atlantic Seaboard: Informally called Cape Town\\'s Riviera, the Atlantic Seaboard is a string of oceanfront communities on Cape Town\\'s west coast. This is where one finds the fanciest hotels (mostly boutique properties although there are chains like Radisson), high-rise luxury condos for rent, and of course the eye-catching mansions belonging to Cape Town\\'s elite. Each community, centered around a beach, has its own character from the uber posh Camp\\'s Bay to the fishing village vibes of Hout Bay. \\n Woodstock: Technically a part of City Bowl, Woodstock is like Cape Town\\'s answer to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. If you\\'re interested in art, theater or anything hipsters like, this former industrial area is a destination in itself. It\\'s still a little rough around the edges, and you probably shouldn\\'t wander the streets alone at night, but it\\'s not to be missed. If nothing else, in 10 years you can say you visited Woodstock before everyone knew how cool it was and property developers ruined it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Cape Town has four seasons although they\\'re not as distinct as northern destinations. It has a Mediterranean climate. Summers are dry and not too hot, and winters are rainy, but mild. The highest temperatures occur in February when it can reach the mid-80s°F. The coolest temperatures occur in July when temperatures are typically in the mid-50s°F. June is usually the wettest month with around 14 days of rain. Cape Town is famous for its strong winds. Today, they\\'re good for kitesurfing. Hundreds of years ago they were the cause of many historic shipwrecks. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n MyCiti App: Routes, schedules, live bus locator iOs | Android \\n Uber: Ridesharing, food delivery iOs | Android \\n Cape Town Tourism: \"The official guide\" to Cape Town, local recommendations iOs | Android \\n VoiceMap: Audio walking and cycling tours, GPS navigation iOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n Charleston, South Carolina, has been named Travel + Leisure readers’ favorite U.S. city in our “World\\'s Best Awards” survey year after year for several convincing reasons. While the Southern port city is known for centuries-old cobblestones and horse-drawn carriages, its dynamism and forward momentum are apparent across all facets of the city —\\xa0from its top-tier culinary feats to its ever-evolving roster of shops, museums, and must-see attractions. \\n Alongside abiding favorites and famous views — shopping on King Street, wandering down Rainbow Row, snagging a table at Fig or The Ordinary, venturing out to one of the nearby beaches — the city continuously boasts a variety of exciting openings and relative newcomers that quickly ingrain themselves in Charleston culture. Stop by Babas on Cannon for European-inspired dishes, an espresso, and maybe an aperitif or two. Classic southern Italian meets Lowcountry at Sorelle, an all-day restaurant, bar, and market spanning two stories of 88 Broad Street. Food tends to be a popular topic of conversation in Charleston, as the F&B scene is paramount for most visitors, but there’s plenty to do in between meals. When you’ve reached the point where you can\\'t fathom eating another bite, venture to neighboring Mount Pleasant, where you’ll find a curation of local art at Charleston Artist Collective and a stellar sunset overlooking Charleston Harbor from Pitt Street Bridge. \\n Whether you’re planning your first trip to Charleston or you, understandably, keep coming back to the Holy City, this T+L Charleston travel guide will help you get the most out of your visit — whenever you choose to go. \\n Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time To Visit\\n\\n Charleston attracts international and domestic tourists all year round, but you’ll find different weather, events, and downtown decor depending on the month you choose to visit. \\n Rain is relatively common in spring, but it\\'s arguably one of the best times of the year in Charleston, with temperatures varying from 60 to 80 degrees and Southern blooms like wisteria, jasmine, and azaleas coming out in full force. The peak of wisteria season (\"wisteria hysteria\") falls in mid-March, right after the Charleston Food + Wine Festival, where the Lowcountry shows off its diverse, world-renowned food culture on a larger stage. Charleston Jazz Festival happens in April, a month that also marks the opening of Charleston Farmers Market’s regular season in Marion Square. The beloved Festival of Houses and Gardens concludes mid-month, followed by Spoleto, a 17-day performing arts festival that takes over the city from late May to early June. If you’re headed to Charleston in the spring, just be prepared for crowds, traffic, lines, and hard-to-find parking. \\n Fall is also a popular time to visit Charleston, as the weather is defined by moderate days and crisp evenings. Oyster season begins in early October; and historic house tours return after a long, hot summer. Social media listings are your best tool for finding local oyster roasts, but you\\'ll need to purchase tickets in advance for the Preservation Society of Charleston\\'s Fall Tours. Choose from guided tours through private homes, self-guided strolls through Charleston\\'s most beautiful gardens, or walking tours down the historic streets. \\n Winters in the Southeast are typically mild and occasionally rainy; temperatures rarely drop low enough for snow flurries. That said, December is a magical time in Charleston. Historic homes lining lower King, Meeting, Legare, Church, Broad, and South Battery Streets are dressed to the nines in breathtaking magnolia garland, cheerful wreaths, and flickering candles in the windows. The annual Holiday Festival of Lights, a three-mile driving tour through James Island County Park, is a favorite family-friendly activity in the evenings. February is the unofficial start of festival season, as Charleston sets up for the Southeastern Wildlife Exhibition (SEWE), a weekend celebration of all things outdoors—including art, sporting exhibitions, and the can\\'t-miss dock dog competition. \\n Although coastal breezes provide some relief, summer’s heat — think high 80s and low 90s — thunderstorms, and humidity make it less than ideal for tourism, but there are still a few reasons to visit Charleston in June, July, and August. Namely, the city’s access to sand and salt water. Just a 15 to 30-minute drive from downtown, Sullivan\\'s Island, Isle of Palms, and Folly Beach bring their own unique appeal to beach-goers. Add Kiawah Island to your summer beach bucket list if you\\'re prepared to drive a little further. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Charleston to Save Money, Hit the Beach, and Avoid the Crowds \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Charleston International Airport (CHS) is about a 20-minute drive from most Charleston attractions. Renting a car is optional, as Ubers and Lyfts are readily available, and parking can be tricky —\\xa0particularly if you’re headed to the beach or attempting to find a spot downtown. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels & Resorts\\n\\n Travel + Leisure readers named The Loutrel, which opened in November 2021, the best hotel in Charleston — a title earned thanks to its upscale Lowcountry style, rooftop cocktail service, amenities, and iconic downtown location. The boutique hotel’s front doors open to State Street, just a short walk from Charleston sights like The Battery, the Pineapple Fountain in Waterfront Park, and Rainbow Row. \\n If a boutique hotel with thoughtful touches at every turn is your favorite kind of accommodation, book a room at The Pinch in the Ansonborough neighborhood. More than just a 22-room property, the hotel also features three furnished residences — which can be reserved for stays of 30 days or longer — a spa, daily complimentary breakfast, and a 40-seat oyster bar, known as The Quinte. \\n Billed as a “boutique escape-meets-experience hotel,” The Ryder Hotel may have already made an appearance or two on your Instagram feed. The bright, airy rooms and common spaces have a relaxed feel to them — the exact kind of atmosphere you’d expect when visiting a coastal city. \\n The Dewberry, which describes itself as \"offering old-world charm with a distinctive modern edge,\" is right downtown, just a block from King Street. On the main floor, you\\'ll find the cozy Living Room, where you can refresh with coffee or cocktails or grab a bite to eat. Its rooftop restaurant and bar, Citrus Club, offers unparalleled views of Charleston and equally-as-photogenic tropical drinks. \\n Emeline is set in the heart of historic Charleston and home to Frannie and The Fox, an Italian eatery that has hotel guests and locals alike flocking to the wood-fired pizza and outdoor dining options. After brunch or before dinner, take one of the custom Emeline bikes out for a spin around the neighborhood. \\n Guests at the expertly curated boutique inn and tavern — born out of the creative minds behind Charleston firm Basic Projects — enjoy Southern hospitality in Old Village Mount Pleasant, a 10-minute drive from downtown. The Post House Inn is the definition of a bright, photogenic escape—and it’s only a block away from the waterfront. \\n Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n Three restored historic homes and two brick carriage homes house 16 luxurious rooms that exude rest and relaxation. After a long bike ride around the neighborhood (on complimentary beach cruisers, of course), begin your evening with a cocktail in the outdoor courtyard before tucking into the seasonal fare offered at the on-site Zero Restaurant. \\n Read More: The 15 Best Hotels in Charleston \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n A 2023 newcomer, Sorelle brings its extensive housemade bread and pasta program, antipasti counter, and wine room (among numerous other features) to Broad Street. Its Italian menu is spearheaded by Chefs Adam Sobel and Nick Dugan, but it falls under the umbrella of acclaimed Chef Michael Min’s award-winning Mina Group. \\n A 20-plus-year Charleston veteran, FIG continues to fill its tables with both regulars as well as those hoping to get their first taste of Chef Mike Lata’s fresh fish entrees and seasonal dishes. Reservations for the in-demand restaurant can be hard to come by, and count yourself lucky if you can sneak into a seat at the bar. \\n The South Carolina-born pitmaster rose to barbecue fame after winning Best Chef Southeast at the 2018 James Beard Awards and appearing in the Netflix show, Chef\\'s Table: Barbecue. Complete with a drive-through and bright blue picnic tables, Rodney Scott\\'s BBQ is home to every Southern delicacy you could possibly imagine: collard greens, hush puppies, banana pudding, and crunchy pig skins. \\n They don\\'t take reservations and you might see a line out the door, but don\\'t let that keep you from the fresh seafood at local-favorite hotspot 167 Raw. The wait is worth it for the crispy oysters, scallop po\\'boys, and ever-changing menu of \"frozie\" cocktails. \\n Charleston restaurateur and entrepreneur Brooks Reitz is the mastermind behind Leon\\'s (as well as Little Jack\\'s Tavern, Monza Pizza Bar, Melfi\\'s, and Jack Rudy Cocktail Company). Set in a former body shop, Leon\\'s features a relaxed atmosphere with top-of-the-line fried chicken, char-grilled oysters, cocktails, and soft-serve ice cream. A reservation for larger parties is advised, but last-minute diners and small groups can usually find space either inside or on the spacious outdoor patio. \\n Reservations and outdoor dining options? Yes to both. A stagnant menu? Not at all. Chez Nou, found on Instagram @cheznouscharleston, posts its European-inspired lunch and dinner menu each day: two appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts. \\n Booking a table at The Ordinary is recommended as the raw bar and delicious libations are in high demand. The former bank building, which sits smack dab in the middle of King Street, can only be described as “buzzing,” with guests excitedly devouring local peel-and-eat shrimp, raw oysters, and other concoctions born from the sheer genius of The Ordinary’s chefs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Going to the beach when visiting Charleston is a no-brainer; the pristine South Carolina coast can\\'t be beaten. Most locals prefer Sullivan\\'s Island, with its access to a variety of restaurants and bars just a few blocks back from the beachfront, while the neighboring Isle of Palms is ideal for families). The crowds of Folly Beach can be intimidating, but just keep driving further down E. Arctic Ave; you\\'ll find more parking and more room on the beach as you move away from the center of town. \\n You can explore downtown Charleston yourself, but you may miss out on some important facts, architectural tidbits, and historical insight, the kind you’ll find on a guided tour. Founder of Walk & Talk Charleston Tyler Page Wright Friedman and her team offer a variety of fascinating tours, including one exploring the LGBTQ+ history of Charleston, a walking tour focused on the role of horses throughout Charleston’s history, and a tour featuring Charleston and the Lowcountry’s natural history. \\n Take in the Charleston skyline from the water by booking a sunset sail around the harbor. Don\\'t forget your phone or a camera—you won\\'t get better views of the Battery or the majestic Ravenel Bridge anywhere else. \\n Across the Cooper River and Charleston Harbor lies Shem Creek, where you can rent kayaks or paddle boards to paddle alongside dolphins and explore the surrounding creek and marsh. Once you\\'re done for the day, follow up your adventure with a drink or meal at one of the many restaurants in the area. \\n The surrounding Lowcountry, filled with live oak trees and Spanish moss, is just as picturesque as the historic homes downtown. Twenty minutes from downtown is Angel Oak, a several-hundred-year-old live oak that shades over 17,200 square feet. The best part? You can leave your wallet at home; it\\'s free for all guests. \\n Call it touristy, but taking in Charleston\\'s history from a horse carriage is one of the most popular tours in the area. Choose from a personal ride with just your party or join in the larger tours as your guide takes you around the quaint Charleston streets. \\n History buffs flock to Charleston, which played a key role in both the Revolutionary and the Civil Wars. Fort Sumter can only be accessed by boat, but Fort Moultrie is a quick visit after a day exploring Sullivan\\'s Island. \\n Read More: 28 Best Things to Do in Charleston, South Carolina \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Downtown Charleston: Otherwise known as the peninsula, downtown Charleston includes several distinct neighborhoods, each with its own history pick of restaurants, shops, and iconic Charleston landmarks. South of Broad, the area below Broad Street, is where you\\'ll find The Battery; Harleston Village is mostly filled with locals and College of Charleston students who frequent Colonial Lake. Cannonborough/Elliotborough is alight with creativity and delicious treats; pick up a cupcake from Sugar Bakeshop while walking along Cannon Street. The French Quarter is a classic stop for Charleston first-timers; Charleston City Market, the Gibbes Museum of Art, and the South Carolina Historical Society are all in the area. \\n Mount Pleasant: Crossing the Ravenel Bridge leads you to Mount Pleasant. Equal parts suburb, shopping destinations, bars, restaurants, and outdoor activities, Mount Pleasant is one of the largest towns in South Carolina. While there, head to Old Village Historic District to catch the unparalleled views from Pitt Street Bridge—which used to connect the town to the adjacent Sullivan\\'s Island. \\n Sullivan\\'s Island: A two-and-a-half-mile-long barrier island, Sullivan\\'s Island is more than just a beach town. Besides the sandy shore, there are several popular restaurants (including Poe\\'s Tavern, The Obstinate Daughter, and Home Team BBQ), bike paths, and some of the dreamiest beach houses you\\'ll find in the Charleston area. \\n Isle of Palms (IOP): Alternating houses of residents and renters can be found along the main road on Isle of Palms, Palm Boulevard. Connected to both Sullivan\\'s Island and Mount Pleasant, IOP is also home to Wild Dunes Resort and Golf Course. \\n Daniel Island: Between the Cooper and Wando Rivers, Daniel Island is one of Charleston\\'s best places for outdoor activities. Golf courses, parks, and trails are easily accessible and can be reached in just 20 minutes from downtown. \\n Johns Island: The largest island in South Carolina, Johns Island is flanked by James Island, Folly Beach, Kiawah Island, and Seabrook Island. Here you\\'ll find the famous Angel Oak tree and several golf courses, both private and public. \\n James Island: Take in the marsh views and iconic trees on James Island, an area once used as mostly farmland. For travelers looking for slightly lower accommodation prices than what you\\'ll find downtown, James Island features several more budget-friendly hotels and rentals to choose from. \\n Folly Island: Beach bars, cafes, souvenir shops, seafood markets, taco shacks, and golf cart rentals—what else does a beach town need? Folly Island is one of the most popular South Carolina beach destinations due to its proximity to downtown Charleston and the sheer amount of entertainment for beach-goers of all ages. \\n Kiawah and Seabrook Islands: Privacy and quiet are two things you\\'ll find upon venturing further out into the gated communities of Kiawah and Seabrook Islands. The Sanctuary at Kiawah Island Golf Course, a five-star hotel with unbeatable ocean views, is pure luxury and relaxation—a must-stay for special occasions and celebrations. You can\\'t get on either island without a pass, but Kiawah\\'s Beachwalker Park is open to the public. \\n North Charleston: Many Charleston travel guides make the mistake of leaving out North Charleston—which is continuously adding new places to eat, drink, and stay. Restaurants like Jackrabbit Filly and EVO Pizza are worth the trek when the peninsula becomes overcrowded by the influx of summer tourists. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n King Street is known as the shopping Mecca of Charleston—with stores ranging from local companies like Old Whaling Company, Berlin’s, and Beau & Ro to name brands like YETI, J.Crew, and Brooks Brothers. \\n Family-owned jewelry store Croghan\\'s appears on just about every Charleston list you\\'ll read, and for good reason. Entering the King Street store is like entering another world—diamond rings, antique lockets, and pewter keepsakes are just some of the treasures you\\'ll find around the shop. \\n If you forget your pajamas, or you desperately want to add another striped set to your closet, the Southern brand’s store is open on Lower King. Cozy robes, breezy dressers, and even options for kids are available inside the two-story shop. \\n The Preservation Society of Charleston brings you the best from local artisans and brands, including Brackish Bow Ties, Smithey Ironware, and J. Stark. They can be found alongside books from Charleston authors and other unique items that make memorable gifts for loved ones or tokens for yourself. \\n Designer names run rampant at Hampden Clothing, a luxury store flanked by its sister shops, James and Small, on King Street. Go in with an open wallet and you\\'ll leave feeling seriously stylish; Carolina Herrera, Mansur Gavriel, and Golden Goose are just some of the familiar brands stocked at Hampden. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Shopping Outside of King Street\\n\\n The Cigar Factory, which is on the National Historic Register, features a number of shops along East Bay Street, including textiles at Fritz Porter, non-toxic nail salon The Water Room, and gourmet food emporium Mercantile & Mash. One of the best parts? Unlike King Street, parking at the Cigar Factory is painless and free. \\n Located on Broad Street, right below Colonial Lake, is Burbage\\'s Grocery, a family-run specialty grocery store locals return to again and again. You can pop in for lunch— there\\'s a fully functioning deli in the back—or stop for locally brewed beer, hot sauce, and freshly baked goods. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Nightlife\\n\\n Charleston establishments may not stay as open as late as larger cities like New York or Los Angeles, but King Street is far from sleepy. Throngs of College of Charleston students and bachelor and bachelorette parties frequent establishments like Uptown Social, Prohibition, and The Cocktail Club. \\n If you’re looking for something more lowkey, though, a cocktail, a glass of wine, or a quick nightcap are best enjoyed at a variety of local favorites, including Bar Rollins, Babas on Cannon, Bin 152, Graft Wine Shop, and The Bar & Patio at Husk. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Other Resources\\n\\n Car services like Uber and Lyft are common and relatively affordable in Charleston, but it’s also a walkable and bikeable city. If most of your excursions and explorations are downtown, bring walking shoes or keep an eye out for pedicabs—an enjoyable way to get back to your hotel after dinner or a round of drinks. If you like to explore on two wheels, rent a beach cruiser from Bilda Bike on King Street, which offers daily, weekly, and monthly options. \\n CARTA is Charleston\\'s bus service with a variety of routes throughout the city as well as several Park and Ride locations. Downtown Area Shuttle (DASH) offers three routes on the peninsula (free). \\n A mix of beach gear, walking-appropriate clothing and shoes, and a few elevated pieces should make it in your suitcase before heading to Charleston. Breathable fabrics, like linen and cotton, help make the heat and humidity a bit more tolerable. No matter the season, you’ll want sunscreen, bug spray, and an umbrella. \\n Read More: The Ultimate Charleston Packing List \\n',\n",

              "  'Marco Bottigelli/Getty Images \\n Named one of the best places to travel in 2023 by Travel + Leisure, Copenhagen continues to draw in tourists with its exceptional food, history, and architecture. The city was officially named the UNESCO World Capital of Architecture in 2023. On top of its newly recognized architectural prowess, the city continues to wow tourists with its tried-and-true offerings — whether that\\'s dining at Noma, the Michelin three-starred restaurant that announced its closure in winter 2024, or strolling the always-popular Tivoli Gardens. \\n Here, your essential Copenhagen guide for hotels, things to do, restaurants, and so much more. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Coco Hotel is the hottest new spot in Denmark\\'s capital city. Not only was it voted as the best hotel in Copenhagen by T+L readers in 2022, it also was named one of the best new hotels in the world in 2022 by T+L editors. The 88-room boutique hotel features bold colors, a European-style cafe, and complimentary bikes for guests. It also makes an effort to be green-conscious, planting a fruit tree somewhere around the world every time a guest checks in and running its facility on a private solar-powered grid. \\n Hotel d\\'Angleterre is an iconic, 265-year-old hotel — and it was voted one of the best in Copenhagen by T+L readers in 2022. The charming hotel features modern Nordic design and expansive views of Kongens Nytorv from the suite balconies. With a heated indoor pool — the only one in the city center — and Michelin-starred dining, you might never want to leave. The concierge also offers plenty of V.I.P. experiences for their guests, including cooking classes and history tours. \\n A tranquil retreat in the center of town, the Sanders Hotel is one of the best stays in Copenhagen, with \"midcentury modern touches [that] imbue its 54 rooms with a sense of casual cool,\" Peter Terzian, T+L features editor, previously reported in the 2022 World\\'s Best Awards. It offers an extensive array of amenities, including loaner bikes for guests (don\\'t forget to ask for a prepared picnic basket) and a glass-encased rooftop terrace that serves up delicious breakfast and gorgeous city views. Be sure to book one of the hotel\\'s exclusive excursions, which includes a backstage pass to the Royal Theater — a short two-minute walk away — or a private guided trip down the nearby canals in a vintage mahogany boat. \\n There is exactly one guest room at TheKrane, which is why T+L called it one of the coolest hotels in Copenhagen. The room is inside an old coal crane that dates back to 1944 and hangs 49 feet above the ground on Nordhavn\\'s industrial waterfront. A night\\'s stay comes with a hefty price tag, but it includes more than just a place to rest your head — guests will love the complimentary on-site spa, prearranged airport pickup, and daily breakfast. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Denmark, named the second happiest country in the world in 2023, is home to the world\\'s very first happiness museum. Opened in 2020, the museum features several different exhibits on how other countries perceive happiness. \\n CopenHill is Copenhagen\\'s first ski area — carefully constructed atop a waste management center for the city. In the summer months, visitors can also hike, run, or tackle the world\\'s tallest climbing wall at this urban recreation destination. \\n Located on three islands, surrounded by lush gardens and a large lake, Frederiksborg Castle is a perfect day trip from Copenhagen. The castle is also home to the Museum of National History, which traces 500 years of Danish history through art, furniture, sculptures, and more. \\n Don\\'t let the word \"gardens\" fool you, this expansive park is home to one of the best theme parks in Europe, open from mid-April to mid-September. In the winter, there\\'s still plenty to see and do, with a whimsical Christmas market, over-the-top decorations, and stunning lights. There are plenty of shops and restaurants on the grounds as well. \\n Read More: 20 Best Things to Do in Copenhagen, From a Palace Visit to Waterfront Strolls \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n A design aficionado\\'s dream, Illums Bolighus is your one-stop shop for Danish design. With top interiors brands, this is a great under-the-radar spot to snag some memorable souvenirs. \\n This buzzy street is home to some of the best shops in Copenhagen. You can find vintage clothing, organic produce, and 40 art galleries. Make sure to check out the ceramics boutiques, including Keramiker Inge Vincents, known for its hand-shaped porcelain. \\n Prefer to do some tax-free shopping before returning to the airport? Visit megastore Magasin, a department store with a fashionable, vintage feel and plenty of variety. The store started in 1869, and it\\'s still a popular choice among locals because it stays open later than most department stores. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Noma is one of the most famous restaurants in the world, and after a 20-year run, head chef René Redzepi recently announced it will close at the end of 2024. So, eat there while you still can. The Michelin three-starred restaurant\\'s menu changes with the seasons, focusing on vegetarian fare in the summer, game and forest-inspired food in the fall, and seafood in the late winter/early spring. \\n At the Alchemist, one of the hardest reservations in Copenhagen, \"guests enter through an ominous, hand-sculpted door made from two tons of bronze,\" reported Christina Liao recently in T+L. Food reporter Liao called it one of the best dining experiences in the world and said diners can expect nearly 50 courses surrounded by performance art and immersive, multi-sensory decor. \\n Alouette is a hidden gem on the Danish dining scene — behind an unobtrusive garage door and past a graffiti-covered hallway lies a surprisingly bright Michelin-starred restaurant that serves a set five-course menu. The menu changes weekly with a focus on small producers and seasonal ingredients. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Copenhagen is best reached by flying into its international airport, which\\xa0T+L readers voted as one of the\\xa0best international airports\\xa0in the world in 2022. Copenhagen Airport serves over 100 destinations and is the biggest airport in Denmark. \\n You can also travel to and from other major European cities, including London, Paris, and Stockholm, aboard\\xa0Rail Europe\\xa0trains or buses. A train ride from London to Copenhagen will take almost 15 hours, while a bus ride could take up to 35 hours, with multiple stops and long transfers. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Times to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Copenhagen is April, May, and September if you\\'re after warmer weather and longer days. You\\'ll encounter fewer crowds than in the peak summer months, but can still enjoy similar temperatures. However, some of the best festivals happen from June to August — like the\\xa0Copenhagen Jazz Festival, which takes place every July. \\n Copenhagen in December is the prime hygge (cozy) and Christmas market season. Travelers can head to the Tivoli Gardens for a gorgeous holiday light display. If you can\\'t make it in December, you can still enjoy a light show in February when the city hosts its now-annual Copenhagen Light Festival. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Copenhagen for Great Weather, Lower Prices, and Fewer Crowds \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n City Center: Copenhagen\\'s City Center is where you\\'ll find hotels like Hotel d\\'Angleterre and Nyhavn, the waterfront district \"tailor-made for Instagram, with colorful townhouses and boats bobbing in the canals,\" Lindsay Cohn, a T+L contributor, previously reported. This area is home to CPH\\'s top attractions, including Kongens Nytorv, the largest public square in the city. \\n Frederiksberg: Frederiksberg is another tourist hot spot within Copenhagen and is home to terrific shopping and attractions like the Frederiksberg Palace and the Copenhagen Zoo. \\n Nørrebro: Northeast of the city center, Nørrebro is \"the most ethnically mixed neighborhood in Copenhagen,\" architect Camilla van Deurs told T+L recently. You\\'ll find some of Copenhagen\\'s best pan-Asian and Middle Eastern restaurants here. \\n Vesterbro/Kødbyen: Vesterbro was once considered Copenhagen\\'s red light district. It\\'s known for its nightlife, but there are also charming, residential, family-friendly areas in the neighborhood, as well. Within Vesterbro, you\\'ll find Kødbyen, otherwise known as Copenhagen\\'s meatpacking district. \\n Christianshavn: Technically a cluster of small islands, Christianshavn is teeming with waterways and charming, colorful row homes. Here, you can rent boats or kayaks to explore the canals or take a dip in one of Copenhagen\\'s harbor baths. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Train, bus, and metro: Copenhagen\\'s public transportation network unites trains, buses, and metros in one easy-to-understand system. Tickets can be purchased at kiosks at the airport and throughout the city, on the DOT Mobilbilletter app, or online, with prices varying by zone. You can also purchase a City Pass, which will give you unlimited access to specific zones depending on which one you purchase. Download the Rejseplanen app to see public transportation schedules with minute-by-minute updates. \\n Taxis: Taxis are plentiful in Copenhagen. If you need a cab, there are several companies, like Dantaxi, you can contact directly for pickup. \\n Car service: If you don\\'t want a taxi, you can book town car or black car services with companies like Sixt to help you get around, or use the zero-emission ride-sharing service Viggo. Copenhagen is not serviced by Uber or Lyft. \\n Bikes: Copenhagen is a city best explored by bike. In fact, according to the Copenhagen Tourism website, 49 percent of locals commute to work on bikes. Plan your ride around the city\\'s many biking routes and bridges, or try to tackle the bike route used in the 2022 Tour de France Grand Départ, which took place in Copenhagen. \\n',\n",
              "  'Costa Rica literally translates to \"rich coast,” and it’s easy to see how it got its name. In addition to world-class beaches on both the Caribbean and Pacific, this peaceful paradise boasts some of the most bio-diverse ecosystems on Earth. In fact, scientists say five percent of the world\\'s species are found here. For reference, the country is only as big as West Virginia. \\n The unparalleled wildlife watching includes encounters with slumbering sloths, majestic scarlet macaws, tree frogs as pretty as they are poisonous, and endangered nesting sea turtles. With dogged determination, they survive, symbiotically, in the shadow of some of the world\\'s most active volcanoes. \\n Whether you want to hike in a cloud forest at 10,000 feet above sea level or you dream of riding horses on a white sand beach, it’s never been easier to reach the rich coast. There are nonstop flights to Costa Rica from more than a dozen U.S. cities. Come in winter; the country is one of the best places to visit in January. Or, plan a trip for the summer months when hotel rates drop as temperatures rise. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n With its audacious architecture and cheeky decor, W Costa Rica – Reserva Conchal stands out on a coast filled with cookie cutter beach resorts. Rooms run the gamut from traditional queens with balconies and ocean views to treehouse suites with private plunge pools. The property has a spa, 18-hole golf course, beach club, adults\\' and kids\\' pools, and five restaurants. \\n This adults-only oasis was voted one of Central America’s best resort hotels by T+L readers. “From the moment you arrive you feel pampered,” Erica Linares, a Latin America specialist at Kensington Tours told Travel & Leisure. She’s a fan of the welcome drink, Costa Rica’s answer to the Bloody Mary. Meanwhile Emmanuel Burgio, a T+L Top Travel Advisor specializing in Central America, praises the private plunge pools. \\n Located four miles from San José\\'s airport, this hotel is an ideal base for exploring the capital. That said, it feels a world away from all things urban thanks to its valley views and meticulously manicured gardens and outdoor spaces, including several pools and a coffee plantation. \\n This family-friendly resort is one of Travel + Leisure\\'s top 500 hotels in the world. “It commands one of the best locations in Costa Rica and offers easy access to the country’s most beautiful beaches,” James Kaiser, author of “Costa Rica: The Complete Guide” told Travel & Leisure. His pro tip is to bring binoculars to spot the humpback whales migrating offshore in winter. \\n Also voted one of the best resorts in Central America by T+L readers, this luxurious ecolodge on the Osa Peninsula is the perfect place to immerse oneself in nature. In addition to proximity to wildlife, Burgio loves the waterfront location. “The bungalows boast terraces with ocean views and outdoor showers, and the shared outdoor pool overlooks the Pacific.” \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Between its diverse flora, fauna, and geothermal features, Costa Rica is a nature-lover\\'s paradise. A quarter of the country is set aside for conservation, and there are 28 National Parks to choose from. “Plus, unlike Colombia or Brazil, you can visit multiple ecosystems in one day,” said Kaiser. \\n Between Costa Rica\\'s 300 beaches there are waves for diehards, beginners, and everyone in between. One of the best places to practice is Tamarindo, where Iguana Surf\\'s instructors are as passionate about teaching as they are pipelines. As you improve, try the Nicoya Peninsula. According to Linares, “It’s known for its powerful waves and the town of Santa Teresa has a very relaxed, bohemian atmosphere.” \\n Wellness is a way of life in Costa Rica – it\\'s home to one of the world\\'s five blue zones – so it seems sacrilegious to not get a spa treatment while in town. Vida Mía Healing Center & Spa sits atop a \"high vibrational crystal mountain\" and was named \"Best Spa in the Americas.\" \\n Often considered to be the birthplace of ziplining, Costa Rica offers canopy tours almost everywhere there are trees. Hanging bridges are usually an option, too. At Selvatura Park in the Monteverde cloud forest, there are nearly two miles of treetop walkways. \\n If you ask Burgio, one of the most under-the-radar experiences you can have is a private hike through the Talamanca Mountains with a guide from the indigenous Cabécar community. According to Burgio the Pacuare River is also the best place in Central America for whitewater rafting. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n With its insect hotel, working farm, coffee plantation, and sugar cane fields, Hotel Belmar takes farm-to-table to a whole new level. As a result, its pride and joy – Restaurant Celajes – is so well-respected diners drive from as far away as San José just for dinner. \\n According to Kaiser, the country’s best food is found on the Caribbean coast where “ the vibrant Afro-Caribbean culture spices things up.” Lidia’s Place is where he goes for the best Caribbean chicken. A small, family-owned establishment, don’t be surprised if Lidia stops by to say hola. \\n Translating to healthy banana, Sano Banano serves feel-good food – breakfast, lunch and dinner – in an open-air restaurant. Enjoy seating on the back patio or front porch overlooking Montezuma\\'s lively main street and don’t miss the artisanal chocolates for sale by the cash register. \\n Choose from prix-fixe menus, a la carte, or a five-course tasting tour at this Arenal landmark where Linares says the dishes are delicious and the ambiance is just as memorable. Grandma’s roasted chicken, served wrapped in banana leaves, has a cult-like following, so order it before it sells out. \\n This San José institution is famous for its edible experiences derived from “unorthodox and avant-garde culinary techniques.” Since it’s deemed one of the best restaurants in Central America, reservations are a must. And because the chef-driven tasting menu knows no bounds, it’s not ideal for picky eaters. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Costa Rica depends on your goals. If you\\'re looking to snorkel in clear Caribbean waters, opt for the dry season which on the Caribbean side, is mid-May through mid-December. Meanwhile, in the rest of the country, the dry season is the opposite. It runs from December to May. This is when everything is open and roads are passable. If you want to take advantage of low season rates and avoid crowds, visit during the wet season (which is marketed as the green season). \\n For the best cultural events, visit during January for Palmares (basically Carnival) or Easter week. As a Catholic country, many of Costa Rica\\'s biggest holidays correspond with the Church\\'s. Regardless of when you visit, you can always watch sea turtles nest and hatch, go zip lining (they do it rain or shine), and learn how to surf. \\n Related: The Ultimate Costa Rica Packing List \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Costa Rica has two main airports: Juan Santamaria International Airport (SJO) in San José and Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport (LIR) in Liberia. SJO is your best bet if you’re visiting Manuel Antonio, Limón, Arenal, or the Osa Peninsula. It also tends to have the cheapest flights. For trips to Guanacaste and Alajuela, you’ll probably want to fly into Liberia. Both airports offer rental cars. \\n Of course, it’s possible to fly into one airport and out of the other. And transferring between the two is easy thanks to public buses and shared shuttles. The trip takes approximately 3-4 hours depending on traffic. Driving to Costa Rica is not recommended as you’ll have to pass through countries with civil unrest and border crossings can be complicated. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Places to Know\\n\\n There are seven provinces in Costa Rica, and each has its own distinct vibe. Here are three we recommend starting with. \\n San José: The capital boasts the best souvenir shopping and has many cultural institutions including the Museum of Costa Rican Art, the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum, and the National Museum of Costa Rica. It’s also where you’ll find the country’s best culinary offerings. \\n Alajuela: Alajuela is popular with adrenaline junkies as it’s home to Arenal Volcano National Park where you can zipline, hot springs hop, and hike in a cloud forest all in 24 hours. The province is also where you’ll find one of the world’s largest craters in Poas Volcano National Park (reservations required). \\n Limón: Limón is located on the Caribbean side and highlights include Tortuguero National Park and the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge. This province is also where you can experience the country’s incredible Afro-Caribbean culture. Approximately eight percent of Costa Ricans are of African descent. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains and Buses: Costa Rica is rebuilding its train infrastructure, damaged during the 1991 earthquake. For now, buses are the best public transportation. While most are privately owned, fares are low. For example, a four-hour ride might cost $10. \"Directo\" buses offer nonstop service. \"Colectivos” stop pretty much everywhere. \\n Taxis and Shuttles: Costa Rica\\'s official taxis are red or orange (the only cabs licensed for airport pickups) and all have a yellow triangle emblem. It\\'s also easy to pre-book private car services or shuttles online. \\n Rideshare: Although it’s technically not legal, Uber has been operating in Costa Rica since 2015. However, it\\'s limited to major cities and tourist hotspots. DiDi is also an option, but it’s also not that reliable in remote areas. \\n Car Rentals: Car rentals are cheap and plentiful, but keep in mind that most cars are manual, and Costa Rica’s roads don’t have the best reputation (during the wet season, many roads turn into rivers). Try to get a high-clearance SUV with AWD, and if you need extras like a roof rack for surfboards, carseat for kids, cell phone for navigation, or additional drivers, book with Vamos. It’s the only company that offers all of the above for no fee. \\n Jessica Poitevien \\n Frames, Stamps: Getty Images; Photos: Alessandra Amodio/Travel + Leisure \\n',\n",

              "  \"Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty Images \\n Located in the northeast corner of Italy, bordering Austria, travelers will find the Dolomites. Le Dolomiti (in Italian) share some of the alpine styles of neighboring regions, but boast a culture — and even a language — all of their own. \\n Ladin is a language spoken in South Tyrol, Trentino, and Belluno, though you're just as likely to hear German and Italian throughout the region. That's because South Tyrol was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, when it was annexed to Italy. \\n The Dolomites also offer some of the most incredible mountain scenery in Europe, with 18 peaks rising more than 10,000 feet. Dolomitic limestone forms the mountains' peaks, which rise dramatically above green valleys and picturesque lakes that freeze in the winter. The region is a favorite ski destination among Italians and famous for hiking in the summer. Here's everything you need to know about visiting the Dolomites. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go to the Dolomites\\n\\n Michela Sieman/Travel + Leisure \\n The Dolomites are a famed ski destination, with many Italians and visitors heading there during the winter holidays. They have also become increasingly popular in the summer, especially for hiking and nature lovers. During the shoulder seasons — from late March through late May and from early October through mid-December — many resorts and hotels shut down. \\n Related: 15 Best Places to Travel in February \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Places for Dolomites Hiking\\n\\n A cable car will take you up to the summit of this mountain, which is a popular spot for skiing in the winter and hiking come summer. At the first stop on the cable car, you'll find the Masi Wine Bar and Ristorante Col Druscié 1778, which serves apple strudel and spiked eggnog alongside salads and heartier fare. \\n Arriving at the beautiful Lago di Misurina, about 20 minutes by car from Cortina d'Ampezzo, you'll see the yellow rehabilitation center for children, created because the fresh mountain air was believed to cure respiratory ailments. The lake, situated 5,761 feet above sea level, draws people in all seasons to walk the 1.6-mile perimeter, along which there are places to picnic. It's also the access point for hiking the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, a popular trail that departs from the Rifugio Auronzo. \\n This Instagram-famous lake is especially alluring in the summer, when the sun reflects off its emerald waters, around which rises the impressive Seekofel massif. From June to September, you can rent a wooden rowboat (€25 for an hour, €15 every 30 minutes after that) and cruise around the lake, but because it has become so popular, the boathouse often runs out of boats by 11 a.m. If you don't want to wait, it's best to arrive when the boathouse opens at 9:30 a.m. You can also walk around the lake's perimeter, stopping to admire the chapel built in 1904. For a more strenuous hike, you can access the trails that lead up into the mountains from the south end of the lake. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do in the Dolomites\\n\\n Dolomiti Superski is a network of 16 ski resorts with 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) of slopes and 450 lifts that you can access with just one pass. It includes popular destinations like Cortina d'Ampezzo, Alta Badia, Val Gardena, and Marmolada. There are single-day tickets, multiday options, or season passes available online. Of course, you can also buy tickets at the individual lifts. \\n If you don't know how to ski (or just want a break from the slopes), sledding is an exhilarating outdoor activity. At Lago di Misurina, you can ascend the Tre Cime di Lavaredo aboard a snowmobile and sled back down. The driver will drop you off at the Rifugio Auronzo 7,654 feet above sea level, where you can borrow a sled to whiz down. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Dolomites Hotels\\n\\n The grand dame of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the ritziest ski town in the Dolomites, Cristallo boasts a long and illustrious history. Opened in 1901, it hosted an impressive roster during its dolce vita heyday, including Frank Sinatra, Brigitte Bardot, aristocrats like the Duca d'Aosta, and even the U.S. Olympic team, which practiced at the hotel's ice-skating rink in 1956. Now a member of Marriott's Luxury Collection, the property combines alpine charm with the amenities of a luxury hotel, including a relaxing spa and a fabulous bar that serves creative cocktails. \\n A member of the Leading Hotels of the World, this family-run mountain chalet was opened in 1957 by Annie and Ernesto Costa, who still live on the third floor. Their sons now run the property and have added distinctive touches, like a trippy tour of the wine cellar, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and an après-ski club. The resort is so close to Austria that you're just as likely to hear German as Italian. Ask for a peek of Ernesto's impressive collection of vintage motorcycles. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Dolomites Restaurants\\n\\n Run by a young couple, this Michelin-starred restaurant highlights fresh local ingredients, including cheeses and charcuterie made at the owners' agriturismo up the road. The tasting menu is a gastronomic journey into the mountains, with dishes like marinated trout with smoked broth and barley prepared like a risotto with aged cheese, pepper, and bay leaves. \\n If you don't want to splurge on a full meal at SanBrite, you can get a little taste of the owners' sustainable cuisine at their charming wood-paneled agriturismo. The fonduta served with crunchy cubes of toasted bread is not to be missed. \\n This B&B and its restaurant may look traditional, with its wood-paneled walls and old-fashioned chairs, but dishes are presented in a fresh, modern way. Try the spaghettini with braised onion sauce, or go for casunziei, a local specialty of ravioli stuffed with beets and herbs and sprinkled with poppy seeds. \\n\",\n",
              "  'Buena Vista Images/Getty Images \\n Dubai is full of contrasts. There\\'s the glittering skyline of skyscrapers so tall they defy imagination. There is the modern collection of stores and eateries, offering every option a traveler could want. And then there are the luxurious hotels, ready to welcome even the most discerning traveler in style and excess. Then there\\'s the desert with its rolling hills of sand stamped with the footprints of Arabian oryx and gazelles; the souks with their labyrinth of stalls, bins overflowing with a rainbow of spices; and the traditional abra boats ferrying riders across the Dubai Creek. \\n “Dubai is the ideal destination for tourists, and there are a number of reasons why,” Farida Ahmed, a guide and owner of Frying Pan Adventures, told Travel + Leisure. “It is safe, whether you are traveling solo or as a family. That, for me, is one of the most pivotal points on which tourism rests.\" \\n The city, one of the seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has sprouted up from its desert port beginnings to become a sprawling metropolis full of vibrant neighborhoods, record-setting buildings, and over-the-top shopping centers all in the last several decades. \"There is something for everyone and everyone\\'s pocket —\\xa0if you’re looking for budget travel you can absolutely do it in Dubai,\" said Ahmed. \\n Today, Dubai can be fast and slow at the same time — a place to grab an avocado toast and relax on the beach, a place to appreciate a desert conservation reserve, and a place to shop \\'til you drop, all in the same day. It\\'s these contrasts that make Dubai one of the most dynamic and interesting cities in the world. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels & Resorts\\n\\n This luxurious hotel is located in one of the most famous buildings in Dubai and the world: the Burj Khalifa. Armani Hotel Dubai takes up the first eight floors as well as the 38th and 39th floors of the world\\'s tallest tower, offering incredible views of the city and the Arabian Gulf below. Rooms are designed by the hotel\\'s namesake, Giorgio Armani, and feature muted colors that will relax any guest after a long day of shopping at nearby The Dubai Mall. \\n If the Burj Khalifa is the most recognizable building in Dubai, the Burj Al Arab is a close second. Inside this iconic sail-shaped building floating in the middle of The Gulf is one of the most stunning hotels in the city. Each colorful room comes with Hermes amenities and butler service as well as access to the hotel\\'s private beach. \\n Set against rolling sand dunes and roaming oryx, Al Maha, a Luxury Collection Desert Resort and Spa offers guests an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city with 42 individual suites all with their own private pools overlooking unobstructed views of the pristine desert. During your stay, book a dune drive to get your heart pumping or go on a guided nature walk in the desert. In the morning, sit down to breakfast on the veranda and keep your eyes peeled for a few gazelles popping by to say hello over coffee. \\n This unique property was once a working cruise ship that has been converted into a hotel, permanently docked in Dubai. The 13-deck ship features 447 refurbished hotel rooms and suites — including the Royal Suite with a large wood-lined private deck — restaurants, a spa, and a theater. History buffs can tour the ship\\'s bridge and see what the cabins looked like in the 1960s before settling in for a leisurely afternoon tea complete with finger sandwiches, traditional cakes, and warm scones with clotted cream. \\n XVA Art Hotel is a boutique hotel that feels like stepping back in time with its romantic shaded courtyards, dark wood, and rich textiles. The hotel, which was built in what used to be a home in the historic Al Fahidi neighborhood, has 15 individually designed rooms all located around three courtyards. And don\\'t miss a chance to walk through the hotel\\'s art gallery, which features contemporary art from both established and emerging artists. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n One of the best ways to experience a place is through its food and these food tours offer to paint visitors a culinary map of Dubai, which Ahmed said has “now established itself as one of the culinary meccas of the world.”\\xa0Try sweet milky tea in the back alleys of a souk, meat and rice pilaf, stuffed falafels, or learn about the custom of making Arabic coffee while also learning about the history of the city with one of the many female guides. \\n Dubai\\'s Global Village is unlike anything else, showcasing more than 70 cultures at different country pavilions where visitors can shop, eat, and more. Bring a camera and capture a cool photo \"for the \\'gram\" at one of the \"selfie spots\" or catch one of the many shows. \\n Skiing in the desert is possible at Ski Dubai where an indoor slope in the Mall of the Emirates allows ski and snowboard enthusiasts to clip or strap in and hone their skills. Playing in the snow more your thing? Try the twin-track bobsled experience or take some time to hang out with the resident gentoo and king penguins. \\n The Burj Khalifa is the tallest tower in the world and the view from the top is rightfully spectacular. Take in Dubai\\'s many neighborhoods with this bird\\'s eye view from the 125th floor or book a spot on the world\\'s highest observation deck with an outdoor terrace on the 148th floor. The Burj Khalifa VIP experience includes access to the world’s highest lounge on the 154th floor. \\n Ahmed recommended checking the weather forecast before you book a trip up the Burj Khalifa, noting that “if it\\'s not a clear day you are not going to be seeing anything but haze.” For your best chance of a clear view, she noted that “the sky tends to be clearer before sunset.” \\n Learn all about falconry from a team of professional falconers on a tour with Royal Shaheen — and get the chance to handle some of the magnificent animals yourself. These tours are interactive and family-friendly, and allow guests to learn both traditional and modern falconry training techniques. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n The Dubai Mall holds the Guinness World Record for the largest shopping center in the world with more than 1,200 retail outlets, including two major department stores: Galeries Lafayette and Bloomingdale\\'s. It also has more than 200 food and beverage outlets. Basically, it\\'s so big you could easily get lost for days. The mall even developed its own app with turn-by-turn navigation to help shoppers reach (and return from) their destination. Beyond shopping, the mall has an aquarium and an Olympic-sized ice rink. The vibe and decor change depending on which part of the mall you\\'re in, so plan to spend some time exploring. An added bonus: it\\'s air-conditioned. \\n The Mall of the Emirates is slightly smaller than the Dubai Mall, but still features more than 630 brands and more than 100 places to grab a bite. Beyond the stores themselves, visitors will find the city\\'s indoor ski slope and a bowling alley. (If your phone dies while you\\'re shopping, you can borrow a portable charger for free.) \\n This shopping destination stretches along more than one mile of beachfront and features both international designers and fun pop-up markets. Check out Sauce for beachy and boho-inspired dresses and cool rattan bags before grabbing a bite at one of the restaurants overlooking the gulf. \\n Arnaud_Martinez/Getty Images \\n Dubai may be known for its modern skyscrapers, but there\\'s another side to the city where traditional souks sell everything from souvenirs to beautiful scarves. Choose from towering racks of fabric at the Textile Souk in the historic Bur Dubai neighborhood or hop across the Dubai Creek to browse endless rows of jewelry stores selling gold bangles and sparkling gems in the Gold Souk. And remember: haggling is all part of the fun. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Al Khayma Heritage Restaurant is part museum and part eatery. The restaurant, which boasts a covered dining courtyard with a tree, has live music, and fresh-made bread, and the staff is dressed in traditional robes. “Do not leave the city without trying Al Khayma Heritage Restaurant,\" said Ahmed. \"It is one of the few restaurants in Old Dubai that\\'s been recognized. The food is great and I love the decor.” The restaurant has earned the Michelin\\'s\\xa0Bib Gourmand\\xa0designation. \\n The Syrian fare served at Al Farooj Al Shami is second to none. Grilled meats, fresh-made sauces, and a mouth-watering list of hot appetizers make this local spot one of Ahmed’s must-visits. \\n You\\'d be forgiven for thinking you were in California or Tulum when you settled into the shaded courtyard of Comptoir 102. Order an avocado crostini, halloumi salad, or gluten-free buckwheat pancakes, and recharge with a chai latte made with homemade almond milk. After you\\'re done eating at this organic cafe, pop over to the attached concept store where you\\'ll find boho dresses, unique glassware, jewelry, and more. \\n Dinner at Al Hadheerah is more than just a meal, it\\'s an experience. Ten live cooking stations delight guests as they feast under the stars in the middle of the desert, offering classic dishes like shawarma and lamb ouzi cooked underground as well as salads like hummus and tabbouleh. And don\\'t forget dessert where you can sample favorites like kunafa and baklava. Reservations are recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Dubai is during the winter when the year-round hot weather starts to cool. In general, temperatures start to dip in October and it remains only moderately hot through May. While the hot season is from June to September, it\\'s worth noting that air conditioning is plentiful across Dubai. \\n “The really amazing months for me are November to February,” said Ahmed, who noted that when winter arrives in Dubai, “we literally crawl out of our hibernation phase and it\\'s all about spending time at the beach and desert BBQs.” \\n Winter is also when the Dubai Shopping Festival takes place. It\\'s a December and January event that is known for its great deals, live entertainment, and raffles. \\n nantonov/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n The best way to get into Dubai is by plane. Thousands of flights arrive at Dubai International Airport (DXB) each week, making it one of the busiest airports in the world. It is located in the northern part of the city, making it the best option for travelers who will be staying and playing on the northern side of Dubai. \\n The newer Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), also known as Dubai World Central, started welcoming travelers in 2013 and is still under construction. The airport provides access to the growing southern end of the city. When it is completed, it will be the world’s largest airport. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Lara Antal/Travel + Leisure \\n This area is a collection of neighborhoods around Dubai Creek (Khor Dubai), including Deira and the Al Fahidi historical neighborhood. A stroll through this area — lined with low-profile gypsum, sand, and coral buildings — will give visitors a small taste of what Dubai was like before the modern construction boom. Spend some time exploring the area\\'s souks or hop on an abra for a boat ride along the creek, which used to be the entry to the pearl diving port. \\n Angelo Cavalli/Getty Images \\n These neighborhoods, which sit next to each other, form one of the best places to go for a waterfront stroll. Grab a bite to eat with a view of the gulf in Jumeirah Beach Residences before getting ice cream and walking over to the marina to watch the sunset on the water, surrounded by towering modern skyscrapers. \\n This is one of the most iconic neighborhoods in the city, home to the Dubai Mall, the Burj Khalifa, and the Dubai Fountain, which puts on a fantastic show every 30 minutes each night. Shop \\'til you drop, head up to the top of the tallest tower in the world, or grab a seat at one of the many restaurants surrounding the fountain for dinner and a show. \\n This palm-shaped island is man-made and dotted with luxury hotels and beach clubs. Kids will love the over-the-top waterpark at Atlantis, The Palm, while adults will enjoy whiling away the day at one of the many pool decks. For a bird\\'s eye view of the island itself, try skydiving — just remember to stop screaming long enough to take it all in. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n kolderal/Getty Images \\n Taxis are the default way to get around Dubai, but if you want to really explore the city and the neighboring emirates, Ahmed recommended renting a car. “It will make your life easier plus it will open up the possibility for you to explore the other emirates in the UAE. If time is of the essence, get yourself a car,” she said. \\n She noted that the metro is great if you’re staying in and traveling around Old Dubai, but if you want to explore New Dubai or go further afield, taxi hires and car rentals are the easiest way to get around. \\n Taxis: Dubai has an extensive network of taxis that bring travelers throughout the city. It\\'s easy to hail a taxi at popular attractions like the malls and the beach. For women who feel more comfortable with a female driver, the city even has \"Ladies and Families\" taxis, which are always driven by women. Those looking to schedule a taxi ride can use apps like Uber and Careem, which operate throughout the city. \\n Trains: The Dubai Metro is cooler than your average subway, featuring automated and sleek cars, WiFi, and even separate cars that women and children can use. (The Red Line even holds the Guinness World Record for the longest driverless metro line at more than 32 miles long.) There are nearly 30 metro stations and a good amount of the track is outdoors, passing by iconic landmarks like the Burj Khalifa and making it a great way to see the city and get from Point A to B. Passengers can purchase single, return, or day-pass tickets — or get a cashless smart card called Nol. \\n Buses: Dubai has more than 1,500 buses that cover a hefty majority of the city\\'s urban areas. \\n Abra: Travelers can ride these traditional wooden boats between the Bur Dubai area and the Deira area where Dubai\\'s Gold Souk, Textile Souk, and Spice Souk are located. \\n',\n",
              "  'Dublin is a city brimming with history, from centuries-old cathedrals to stately manors that line the winding streets. Institutions like Dublin Castle, the National Gallery of Ireland, and St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral have long drawn tourists looking to catch a glimpse of the city\\'s rich history, while places like Trinity College highlight Dublin\\'s literary past — after all, there\\'s a reason the city is called \\'the land of saints and scholars.\\' \\n Spirits lovers will find themselves right at home amongst favorite spots like the Guinness Storehouse, the Jameson Distillery, and the Teeling Distillery. And Irish cuisine, once considered a bit of an oxymoron, is on full display in Dublin. The city is now home to five Michelin-starred restaurants, plus an array of international restaurants that highlight the diversity of the city. \\n So whether it\\'s history, architecture, or literature that piques your interest, or you\\'re most focused on food and spirits, there\\'s plenty to keep you busy on your next trip to Dublin. Here, our favorite spots in \\'The Pale.\\' \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Irish Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Winter weather in Dublin is less than ideal, with temperatures averaging in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit. But the city offers a number of festivals that make up for the chilly weather. There\\'s the New Year\\'s Festival which takes place for three days at the start of each year, the Dublin International Film Festival every February, and a five-day-long St. Patrick\\'s Day Festival in March. \\n St. Patrick\\'s Day in Dublin is more so celebrated by travelers than locals. However, you\\'ll still find quite the crowd congregating around the city\\'s Temple Bar neighborhood indulging in the revelry. Locals view the day as more of a reflective occasion to celebrate relationships, family, and faith. \\n As the weather starts to get a bit nicer, travel to the city starts to pick up significantly, but that also means that prices tend to increase. In late spring and summer there are a host of festivals to keep anyone busy, including the International Literature Festival in May, Bloomsday (a celebration of author James Joyce) and Pride in June, and the Festival of Curiosity in July. \\n The autumn months are particularly beautiful as leaves start to change color throughout the city and its many parks.

              "  'Named one of the best places to travel in 2022 by Travel + Leisure editors, the Finger Lakes region in central New York maintains a distinct identity. The \"centrally isolated\" geographic positioning of FLX, as it\\'s been dubbed in recent years, means denizens take great pride and intentionally invest in this dispersed assortment of towns and sites full of rich, diverse histories. Ever since Ukrainian immigrant Dr. Konstantin Frank planted his first vitis vinifera vines in 1958 on 188 sloping acres along western Keuka Lake, the Finger Lakes\\' profile as a wine region has quietly been on the rise. A new generation of restaurants and hotels is evolving into a robust hospitality ecosystem, making the range of Finger Lakes experiences on offer better than ever. \\n From the base of the 1848 women\\'s rights convention in Seneca Falls that catalyzed the suffrage movement to a comprehensive Native American heritage site and Harriet Tubman\\'s home in Auburn, history buffs can investigate pressing questions related to the past and present. Nature lovers can explore the famed, glacially formed gorges and waterfalls and astonishingly scenic vistas around the 11 slender bodies of water — the largest three of which are Keuka, Seneca, and Cayuga — located roughly in the triangle formed by the cities of Rochester, Syracuse, and Corning. Food and beverage enthusiasts can sate themselves touring the Finger Lakes\\' wineries (there are more than 100) and delving into the impressive culinary scene rooted in elevating local and seasonal ingredients. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Times to Visit the Finger Lakes\\n\\n The seasons express themselves intensely and fully in the Finger Lakes. With the exception of active winter sports destinations like Greek Peak Mountain Resort and Bristol Mountain in Canandaigua, winter travel is a niche preference that comes with challenges, namely, an obscene amount of lake-effect snow. (This climate, however, accounts for the world-class rieslings and other varietal wines that thrive in low temperatures.) Unsurprisingly, summer and fall are glorious. Both seasons allow for long hikes followed by invigorating swims, whether in a lake or waterfall, and vendors\\' stalls are piled high with colorful organic summer produce at the Ithaca Farmers Market. Fall ushers in the grape harvest and technicolor displays of fall foliage as the school year gets underway at Cornell University and other school campuses in the area. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Things to Do in the Finger Lakes\\n\\n Ambitious outdoors adventurers can consult the Finger Lakes Trail website for routes, itineraries, and other resources related to the 950-plus-mile-long network. Letchworth State Park, a.k.a. \"the Grand Canyon of the East,\" contains myriad opportunities for adventure, from cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter to whitewater rafting and hot air balloon rides. Letchworth State Park is also home to the Autism Nature Trail, an innovative, neurodiverse-inclusive program. \\n For trails of a different sort, FLX has five established wine trails to help guide visitors eager to investigate the wineries around Canandaigua, Seneca, Cayuga, and Keuka lakes. If making your own itinerary, don\\'t miss the tasting rooms of FLX OG winemakers Hermann J. Weimer Vineyard and the aforementioned Dr. Frank. And for a sense of how the art and science of wine has evolved here beyond the better-known (deservedly so) winter-friendly rieslings, labels such as Heart and Hands, Forge Cellars, and Red Tail Ridge Winery are making impressive strides with crafting red wines using FLX-grown pinot noir and cabernet franc, among other varietals. \\n Beyond the fruit of the vine, the Rochester/Finger Lakes Craft Beverage Trail highlights breweries, cider houses, and distilleries that have kicked into high gear in recent years, primarily in Ontario County. The world of cider is quite compelling, as visitors to Finger Lakes Cider House in Interlaken on Cayuga Lake quickly learn. The rustic-chic dining room also serves an outstanding menu with views of the Good Life Farm and the lake beyond. From its Seneca Drums gin to McKenzie whiskeys, Finger Lakes Distilling has put the region on the map for spirits production using locally sourced grains and fruits. \\n Outstanding among the other unique cultural institutions in FLX is the Corning Museum of Glass. The sprawling facility is an immersive look into the fascinating intersections of craft, art, and design, along with American industrial history. The glass company\\'s unrivaled collection starts with ancient specimens and continues through contemporary cutting-edge art, while the institution pushes the medium forward through its education, research, and artist residency programs. \\n Finally, for a water-oriented outing toward the eastern edge of the Finger Lakes, the town of Skaneateles, at the northern tip of its namesake lake, is another enchanting destination. Book a cruise with Mid-Lakes Navigation, which offers cocktail and dinner cruises aboard different vessels. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Visiting the Finger Lakes\\' Waterfalls\\n\\n \"Ithaca is Gorges\" is a well-known tourism motto and easy conversation starter when spotted outside of the town itself. This geologic feature is certainly worth bragging about and makes the surrounding area one of the most stunning destinations for hiking and swimming in naturally formed channels. Download the Ithaca Waterfalls Challenge digital passport to keep track of its 22 waterfalls and other natural attractions, from the more gentle slopes of Buttermilk Falls and Buttermilk Creek to the diving board perched over a deep swimming hole at Robert Treman State Park. The 215-foot waterfall drop at Taughannock Falls in Trumansburg is a perfect Kodak — OK, Instagram — moment. \\n Watkins Glen State Park near the southern tip of Seneca Lake merits dedicating several hours in order to extensively hike the dramatic trails that hug the glen and take in the breathtaking sight of its 19 waterfalls. (Much of the ingenious infrastructure here and at other nearby sites that carefully respect their contexts were built under the aegis of agencies created during the New Deal.) And the options are plentiful, since FLX counts over 200 waterfalls. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Hotels in the Finger Lakes\\n\\n The Inns of Aurora on Cayuga Lake is a community and hospitality passion project from native Pleasant Rowland, founder of the American Girl empire. The five unique luxury properties that make up the Inns of Aurora each convey their own aesthetic and atmosphere (most are landmarked historic structures). The newest inn is the restored Zabriskie House, which blends retro styling with selections from Rowland\\'s modern art collection and features 11 guest rooms. Inns of Aurora also has a brand-new wellness center, an on-site Ayurvedic counselor, a demonstration kitchen where guests can take cooking classes, and two restaurants. \\n The ultra-chic Lake House on Canandaigua signaled a shift in the FLX hospitality scene when its 125 guest rooms and suites in the re-envisioned retreat debuted in summer 2020. Third-generation family owners who operate the design firm Post Company (formerly Studio Tack) and development arm Brooklyn Home Company breathed new life into the site-sensitive buildings with a fresh take on understated, contemporary luxury. TLEE Spas designed the comprehensive wellness program at the Lake Houses\\'s Willowbrook Spa, which opened in summer 2021. \\n Whether it\\'s for a classic cocktail at Bar Argos, an evening with friends in the funky, welcoming Argos Warehouse outdoor lounge, or an overnight stay at the Argos Inn, any or all of these plans provide a taste of Ithaca\\'s eclectic character. The creative reimagining of this historic house has been adapted into a modern bed-and-breakfast where no two spaces are alike. \\n Firelight Camps, situated just a short drive outside of Ithaca, is the best of both worlds, allowing guests to be close to nature but with the all stylish and creature comforts of a well-designed, modern, bohemian-inflected glamping site. Another perk: co-owner Emma Frisch\\'s culinary expertise makes this your-not-so-typical camping excursion. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Camping in the Finger Lakes\\n\\n The camping options in the Finger Lakes run the gamut and can accommodate anyone, from camping veterans to novices. The Corning KOA Resort south of Watkins Glen splits the difference, with a campground and deluxe cabins, plus a pool and waterslide. Sampson Park at Seneca Lake Resorts in the town of Romulus (one of the many whose names evoke Greek and Roman history) hosts campers, cabin dwellers, and RV drivers. The New York State Parks system operates camping areas with fewer frills but no less awe-inspiring settings, including the Taughannock Falls, Watkins Glen, and Robert H. Treman State Park campgrounds. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Restaurants in the Finger Lakes\\n\\n Elevated homeyness of the best sort sets the tone at Hazelnut Kitchen in downtown Trumansburg. The menu is both sophisticated and hearty, whether you opt for fresh fish or a New York strip steak served with fries and caramelized onions. Alternately, the kitchen designs a tasting experience based on whatever is in season, and it\\'s well worth trying if you\\'re an adventurous diner. \\n F.L.X. Table in Geneva takes an experimental yet highly convivial approach to hospitality, curating prix-fixe menus designed for intimate groups of diners. This venture is part of master sommelier Christopher Bates and restaurant industry pro Isabel Bogadtke\\'s ambitious F.L.X. Hospitality group, which operates multiple concepts including the Quincy Exchange in Corning\\'s Gaffer District, F.L.X. Weinery in Dundee on Seneca Lake, and Roc Brewing Co in Rochester. \\n The Moosewood restaurant became a quasi-household — yet still niche — name thanks to its iconic, best-selling vegetarian cookbooks. Now, the physical space that launched an institution back in 1973 is onto its next chapter, under new ownership. Ithaca native Danica Wilcox, whose mother was a longtime member of the Moosewood collective, has revamped the beloved restaurant, located on the ground floor of downtown Ithaca\\'s Dewitt Mall, as of early 2022. She and her team kept the warm, comforting touchstones of the space and the spirit of the menu intact, while evolving the food and beverage program to engage with the community and host events including FLX-focused wine tastings with local experts. \\n The laid-back vibe at Ithaca Beer Co., home to award-winning brews like Flower Power and Apricot Wheat, make its brewery and taproom outside of town an easy pleasure. When the weather permits, the idyllic arrangement, with views of rolling green meadows and outdoor games, is ideal for families and large groups. Tasting flights pair seamlessly with the menu that\\'s heavy on top-notch comfort food and bar classics. \\n The Stonecat Cafe in Hector reflects the best of FLX unconventional quirkiness, serving unpretentious, high-quality fare paired with a local wine and cocktail list. Visitors can also book a stay on the property. \\n',\n",
              "  'Michelangelo here, Donatello there. As the cradle of the Renaissance, Florence was the city that brought you all those household names – and they\\'re all still here. The famed Uffizi Galleries and the Accademia are just the start – this is a city stuffed to the gills with museums, galleries, and masterpieces aplenty. Churches are full of frescoed chapels and heavily pigmented crucifixes. Houses are hulking palaces, built with hand-hewn, human-sized stones. Even the stores come with ancient beams and painted ceilings. Sometimes, the beauty is overwhelming. \\n That\\'s where the other Florence comes in. This is a city surrounded by nature like no other. Cross the Ponte Vecchio and the river Arno is the Oltrarno district, home to cobblestone piazzas, laidback cafes, and artisans plying centuries-old trades. You can stroll along the riverside, explore exquisite gardens laid out in the Renaissance, or wind around cypress-studded hills. At every turn, you\\'ll get killer views of the city and its gargantuan terracotta dome, standing out against the mountains in the distance. In Florence, even the landscape is art. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Summers are hot, sticky, and super busy, but other than that, any time is good to visit Florence — not least because you\\'ll spend most of your time indoors in the museums. Florence\\'s Easter celebration of the Scoppio del Carro, in which a team of cream-colored oxen tow a wagon into the Piazza del Duomo and then set off the fireworks inside it, is a huge event. In late June, Piazza Santa Croce is closed off to make the pitch for a game of Calcio Storico — or \"historic football,\" a mix of soccer, rugby and wrestling in 16th-century dress. Festa di San Lorenzo takes place each August, where there are celebrations including free lasagne in Piazza San Lorenzo, in honor of former ruler Lorenzo de\\' Medici, the man who kicked off the Renaissance. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language:Italian \\n I don\\'t speak Italian: Non parlo italianoI\\'m lost: Mi sono perso/aI would like…: Vorrei…How much is…?: Quanto costa…?How do I get to…?: Per andare a…?I don\\'t understand: Non capisco \\n Learn more Italian phrases \\n Calling Code:+39Capital City: Rome \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: High-speed trains stop at Florence Santa Maria Novella station. \\n Buses: The city center is largely pedestrianized, though there are trams from the train station that wrap around the center.

Running roughly from the Ponte Santa Trinità to the Ponte alle Grazie bridges, the area north of the Arno contains most of the tourist sites. There are two focal points: Piazza del Duomo, where the gargantuan cathedral swaggers over the city, and Piazza della Signoria, the political heart of the city, where you\\'ll find museums such as the Uffizi and Palazzo Vecchio gathered around one of Italy\\'s most spectacular squares. The Uffizi ends at the River Arno. \\n Santo Spirito: Oltrarno — the name means \"across the Arno\" — covers the city on the other side of the river, but in visitor terms Oltrarno usually refers to the area around Santo Spirito. It\\'s a neighborhood of artisans, small cafes, and grand historic monuments including the Palazzo Pitti and Boboli Gardens. \\n San Frediano: Part of Oltrarno but slightly further west than Santo Spirito, away from the center, laidback San Frediano includes gems such as the Brancacci Chapel, plus traditional restaurants and trattorie with olive-slicked hills rising at the back. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n In a basin surrounded by mountains and hills, Florence is humid. Spring is warm — temperatures are in the mid 50s to 60s, feeling hotter when the sun is out — but summer can be sweltering, with an average temperature of 77°F feeling hotter thanks to the humidity. Fall tends to be sunny, with temperatures averaging low-to-mid 60°F in October. Winters are ostensibly mild, with temperatures in the mid 40s, though the humidity gives them an extra bite. \\n January : 36°F to 52°FFebruary : 36°F to 55°FMarch: 41°F to 61°FApril: 45°F to 66°FMay: 54°F to 75°FJune: 59°F to 82°FJuly: 64°F to 88°FAugust: 64°F to 90°FSeptember: 57°F to 81°FOctober: 50°F to 70°FNovember: 41°F to 59°FDecember: 37°F to 52°F \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n +Firenze: Live updates from the city council.iOs | Android \\n Firenze the Walking City: Best hiking routes around the sites and hills. iPhone only.iOs \\n itTaxi: Taxi ride-hailing service.iOs | Android \\n Firenze Card App: maps and opening hours of museums taking part in the tourist card scheme.iOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'Allard Schager/Getty Images \\n The Florida Keys are like a coral kingdom: a 125-mile chain of islands flung south from the tip of Florida with the ultimate island — Key West — resting just 90 miles from the shores of Cuba. And with one narrow road (and 42 bridges) connecting the isles, just to travel the Florida Keys is to feel on a magical, water-surrounded journey. \\n “There are a variety of reasons to choose the destination, including a wide range of accommodations to meet every style; fresh, local cuisine with a Caribbean flair; water-based activities like sailing and kayaking or paddleboarding; and the best part is access to a world of adventure and romance without needing a passport,” Stacey Mitchell, director of the Florida Keys & Key West tourism board, told Travel + Leisure. She noted that a trip to the Florida Keys “rivals even the most popular island destinations.” \\n While it\\'s possible to hop in a car in Miami and make it to Key West (and the southernmost point in the continental United States) in less than four hours (traffic willing), that defeats the charm and richness of the Florida Keys. Every few miles there\\'s a discovery to be had: a tiki bar, a seafood joint, a beachy resort or boutique hotel, a gorgeous nature preserve, or just a thrilling turquoise vista across the famed saltwater flats toward a blue horizon. \\n So, make a trip of it — spend a few days in Key Largo or Islamorada near the upper end of the archipelago, dally on Marathon or Big Pine Key, and then settle in for some serious quirky culture, history, and bohemia in Key West. Take time to snorkel, dive, and fish, walk the beach, and eat lots and lots of seafood and Key lime pie. And don\\'t worry if you don\\'t get to everything that there is to love and explore in the Florida Keys — you\\'ll be back. \\n To help guide you on your journey, Mitchell recommended “the Florida Keys and Key West travel app which has several great suggestions for places to stop along the Overseas Highway and also gives a guided historical overview.” \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels & Resorts\\n\\n The Bungalows Key Largo: A former trailer park on a stunning stretch of shoreline with a sandy beach has been converted to a lush enclave of small cottages with big luxuries, including private verandas with plunge tubs and outdoor showers. At The Bungalows, there are six restaurants and bars on the property — including a toes-in-the-sand Mexican cantina and a savvy bar with a Hemingway vibe — and a top-notch spa. A panoply of water activities including catamaran excursions make it easy to stay put. Adults only, all-inclusive, and all just 63 miles from Miami International Airport. \\n The Moorings Village: This former coconut plantation re-emerged in the 1960s as a small resort. Today, its aqua-shuttered estate house and sugary stretch of white sand — famously peppered with a grove of listing palms — are straight-up cinematic, and its collection of luxury cottages make for an Old Florida idyll. \\n Isla Bella Beach Resort: This luxury resort on Marathon Key is a game-changer, with ocean views from every room and suite and a high-design feel. The property is set on a mile-long stretch of private beach and surrounded by more than a thousand palms. Five pools, exceptional dining, and an open-air bar with a killer sunset view complete the fantasy. \\n Little Palm Island Resort & Spa: The only private island resort in the United States is hidden away in the Lower Keys. The adults-only enclave is accessible by boat and seaplane and features just 30 thatched-roof bungalows with updated interiors (including floor-to-ceiling glass doors and outdoor copper soaking tubs). To round out the offerings there is a world-class spa with a two-story atrium, private poolside cabanas, and some of the best cuisine in the Keys. \\n Parrot Key Hotel & Villas: Parrot Key Hotel & Villas may be the ultimate Key West hideaway. The property is hidden off a main drag and completely enveloped in five acres of tropical greenery with four swimming pools and a stretch of beach. The feel here is serene and sophisticated, but without airs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park: This state park is a must for snorkelers and divers alike (and if you don\\'t swim, there are always the glass-bottom boat tours). The park’s 70 nautical square miles form the first undersea park in the U.S. and while the upland areas sport mangrove swamps and tropical hammocks, it\\'s the coral reefs that are worth suiting up for (and don\\'t forget, the waters of the Keys are always warm, even in the depths of winter). Join a snorkeling or scuba tour or rent a kayak, paddleboard, or canoe. \\n Turtle Hospital: Leave the old-school petting aquariums behind and fall in love with the residents in rehabilitation here at the first state-licensed veterinary hospital devoted solely to the treatment of endangered sea turtles in the world. The tours are excellent and well worth booking in advance. \\n National Key Deer Refuge: They\\'re tiny, adorable, and unique to the Florida Keys. And now these miniature Key deer are protected, having been saved from the brink of extinction. Start at the visitor and nature center for more on the Key deer, including where to see one and how to explore the refuge\\'s preserved forest, tropical hardwood hammocks, freshwater and salt marsh wetlands, and mangrove forests. \\n Honest Eco Sustainable Nature Tours: Key West is full of cruise charters, but this progressive tour company is head and shoulders above the rest for its commitment to sustainability and environmental education. Owned and operated by biologist Billy Litmer, Honest Eco operates out of the Historic Seaport and features SQUID, Key West\\'s first electric power charter boat. Schedule a dolphin watch and snorkel or an “All the Above” trip, which also includes kayaking and organic vegetarian lunch. \\n Key West Pro Guides: Ready to live that sportfishing dream? The team at Key West Pro Guides can help even a fishing novice get the Hemingway experience on the water — and they\\'re ready to help experts land that trophy fish. “Without a doubt when someone comes to the Florida Keys for the first time, they should get out on the water whether it’s via a fishing charter or snorkel excursion,” said Mitchell. \\n NANCY PAUWELS/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Shell World: Kitschy and over the top, this is a classic Florida Keys tourist stop, but it\\'s truly worth it. Take in the splendor, pick up a souvenir, and know that you\\'re part of a great tradition of roadside attractions. \\n Village Square at the Trading Post: A charming collection of pastel cottages is home to an equally charming collection of shopping and snacking: You\\'ll find some beachy boho fashion, home décor, plants and other botanicals, art, burritos, and coffee. \\n Books & Books: This lovely indie bookstore — and nonprofit and community center for readers and writers — was co-founded by beloved author (and Key West resident) Judy Blume and is ground zero for Key West\\'s literary scene. \\n Gallery on Greene: For collectors and oglers, Nance Frank\\'s gallery with a deep bench of Key West artists (including a stellar roster of Cuban artists) is a must-visit. \\n KINO Sandals: It\\'s rare that a souvenir is truly a local favorite as well, but you won\\'t find a Conch (Key Wester) who doesn\\'t have a perfectly broken-in pair of these leather sandals. Hit the landmark shop founded by Cuban immigrant Roberto \"Kino\" Lopez in 1966 and gape at the 17 designs and myriad shades (you can also watch them being made). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Key Largo Conch House: Let this family-owned institution be your introduction to the conch fritter, a Florida Keys specialty. And if you\\'re in a breakfast mood, tuck into a stack of Key lime pancakes.The Conch House was one of the first restaurants recommended by Mitchell, who noted that the spot is a local favorite. \\n Lorelei Restaurant & Cabana Bar: It\\'s all about catching the sunset and some live music at this toes-in-the-sand favorite, reveling in local delicacies like the house-smoked fish dip and Key lime peppercorn snapper. The \"Frozen\" Key Lime Pie on the dessert menu is renowned. \\n Keys Fisheries: There\\'s nothing better than a seafood dive that’s next door to one of the coast\\'s largest fish exporters, and this salty classic is pure Keys fun (get the stone crabs when they\\'re in season). The Lobster Reuben and Key lime pie are famous (and rightly so), so bring your appetite. \\n South of the Seven: If you\\'re wondering, the name means you\\'re south of the Seven Mile Bridge that marks the Lower Keys. Feel like an insider? Now it\\'s time to celebrate with big picture window views of the water and the Mediterranean-inspired menu in this go-to spot inside the landmark Sugarloaf Lodge. Mitchell calls South of the Seven one of the Keys’ “off-the-beaten-path hidden gems.” \\n Blue Heaven: With its dense foliage and quirky décor, this Key West landmark is the bohemian hangout of choice, whether hitting the little stand-up bar for happy hour or taking a table for a whole blissful brunch, lunch, or dinner. Yes, the rooms upstairs were once a bordello, and yes, Hemingway refereed boxing matches here, and yes, the Key lime pie is the tallest (and most delicious) you\\'ve ever seen. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The climate in the Florida Keys is subtropical, and the proximity to the Gulf Stream and Gulf of Mexico means that the average summer and winter temperatures rarely differ more than 10 degrees. The result is a year-round paradise — except for hurricane season which typically starts in early June and ends in late November. \\n “The winter and spring seasons are among the best times to visit as the weather is cooler and the water temperatures are delightful,” said Mitchell, who noted that “even when the weather is hottest in South Florida, the air in the Keys is still a few degrees cooler.” \\n Most tourists visit between late December and May. During this time it almost never rains, and even if clouds do push through with some showers, they\\'re gone that day. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Most out-of-state travelers get to the Keys by flying into Miami International Airport (MIA) and then hopping in a Florida Key-bound shuttle or taxi. But, the Keys are also home to two international airports of their own: Key West International Airport (EYW) and Florida Keys/Marathon International Airport (MTH). \\n It’s worth checking all three airports when pricing out your flights. \\n bpperry/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: Islands to Visit\\n\\n The Keys are divided into five regions: Key Largo, Islamorada, Marathon, Big Pine and Lower Keys, and Key West. \\n Key Largo: This island is known as “the dive capital of the world” and is home to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, the first underwater preserve in the U.S. \\n Islamorada: Islamorada is famous for its backcountry sport fishing and saltwater fly fishing. The Seven Mile Bridge at Marathon is one of the longest segmented bridges in the world. \\n Big Pine and Lower Keys: Big Pine Key is home to a national refuge that protects the miniature endangered Key deer, which has made an astonishing comeback from near extinction. \\n Key West: This island is famous for the writers who once lived there —\\xa0most notably, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams —\\xa0and the warm and welcoming LGBTQIA+ scene. Key West is closer to Cuba (90 miles) than it is to Miami (159 miles) and is home to a vibrant historic district, an international airport, and marks the southernmost point in the continental United States. \\n aiisha5/Getty Images \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Renting a car in the Key can be convenient —\\xa0until it’s not. Traffic and hard-to-find parking are two very real factors to consider. If you can avoid renting a car, you should. Here’s how: \\n Shuttles: Keys Shuttle and Florida Keys Express Shuttle offer door-to-door shuttle services to the Keys from Miami International Airport. \\n Bus: The Greyhound Keys Shuttle connects various stations in Miami with the Keys — all the way down to Key West. On Key West, the Duvall Loop is a free bus service with 18 stops in Old Town. \\n Taxis: Local cab companies generally service their island area — inquire locally for taxis. A cab stand services passengers arriving at Key West International Airport (EYW) and Freebee in Islamorada has a fleet of on-call electric vehicles. \\n Ridesharing: Uber and Lyft both operate in the Florida Keys. \\n',\n",
              "  'Hilton Head\\'s 12 miles of beaches and slow pace of life have drawn families and travelers for decades. Two dozen golf courses weave through the island\\'s 25,000 acres, including the internationally renowned Harbour Town Golf Links. Balmy, breezy weather makes it a haven for world-class tennis and excellent inshore fishing, while an island-wide network of paved trails makes it possible to travel the island from end to end via bicycle. \\n Before 1956, when the first bridge opened, Hilton Head was a sleepy Southern island. It takes its name from Captain William Hilton, who claimed it for the British crown in 1663. Hundreds of enslaved people toiled on the island\\'s cotton and rice plantations before Union soldiers liberated them in 1861, leading to a century of Gullah-Geechee culture. In the 1960s, the island saw the rapid expansion of tourist infrastructure. \\n Today, Hilton Head\\'s rich cultural and natural history is evident in a tray of oysters at Hudson\\'s Seafood House on the Docks, or in the sweetgrass baskets on display at the Coastal Discovery Museum. New influences, like chef Philippe Feret of Hilton Head Social Bakery, lend the island a worldly flair, while old-school hangouts, like the Lowcountry Backyard, keep it anchored in tradition. \\n Hilton Head is a place to relax, challenge yourself at a world-class golf course, and then relax some more. The island invites long family bike rides, or lazy days wandering back and forth between the beach and an oceanfront pool. Most of all, it\\'s a place to slow down and enjoy the Lowcountry lifestyle. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Hilton Head comes alive during summer, when families descend from the Midwest and across the East Coast for a week of R&R. Shoulder season — April to May (with the exception of the RBC Heritage golf tournament) and September to October (unless there\\'s a hurricane circling offshore) — shows off the island at its best, with moderate temperatures in the 80s, warm water in the ocean, and fewer crowds at restaurants and popular attractions. During winter, the pace slows dramatically, and it\\'s possible to walk for miles on mostly deserted beaches. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Hilton Head seems like a small island, but driving from one end to the other can easily take a half-hour during peak season. You\\'re here to relax, so choose your accommodations based on the part of the island you want to spend the most time on. The Sea Pines Resort dominates the southern half, and offers enough beaches, shops, restaurants, and attractions so you never have to leave. But beaches on the island\\'s north end, including near hotels like The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa, don\\'t get as crowded on busy summer weekends as others closer to the island\\'s middle. Finally, golfers should book tee times well in advance — this is one of the world\\'s premier golfing destinations, so you\\'ll need reservations and a timely arrival. \\n Currency: U.S. Dollar \\n Language: English \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Unless you plan to stay put at a single resort for the duration of your trip, a car is a necessity on Hilton Head. Uber and Lyft both service the island and are readily available. \\n For guests staying within the 4,500-acre Sea Pines Resort, a free trolley shuttles you from Harbour Town to South Beach Marina Village and the beach. \\n Visitors wanting to explore nearby Daufuskie Island or downtown Savannah can hop aboard the Spirit of Harbour Town with Vagabond Cruise, enjoying a ride down the river and four hours to explore the island or the city. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Beach House, a Holiday Inn Resort\\n\\n Address: 1 South Forest Beach Dr., Hilton Head, SC 2992Phone: (855) 474-2882Book Now \\n This resort\\'s centerpiece, the rollicking Tiki Hut beachfront bar, hosts one of the island\\'s biggest parties every afternoon.

But even though there\\'s a dedicated beach clubhouse (and additional pool) for resort guests — accessible via shuttle or bike path — the distance from the ocean makes it best for guests who plan on spending most of their time at the pool, playing golf, or at other nearby attractions. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Inn & Club at Harbour Town\\n\\n Address: 7 Lighthouse Ln., Hilton Head, SC 29928Phone: (843) 363-8100Book Now \\n Rooms at this elegant inn overlook the first tee at the famous Harbour Town Golf Links, making it the perfect place to stay if you\\'re playing a round.

Get pampered at the Arum Spa, or simply kick back in a poolside cabana for the afternoon. Generously sized rooms boast at least 450 square feet, but are set back from the beach, allowing the attractive grounds to take center stage. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa\\n\\n Address: 2 Grasslawn Ave., Hilton Head, SC 29928Phone: (843) 681-4000Book Now \\n This resort\\'s commanding beachfront presence is mirrored by soaring ceilings in indoor communal spaces and comfortable balconies overlooking the ocean and pool complex.

The bakery\\'s location in Shelter Cove includes attractive outdoor seating along the waterfront. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hudson\\'s Seafood House on the Docks\\n\\n Address: 1 Hudson Rd., Hilton Head SC 29926Phone: (843) 681-2772Website \\n Dating back to 1967, Hudson\\'s may be an institution, but it doesn\\'t rely on tourists to keep business bustling. The forward-thinking restaurant doubles as an aquaculture operation, growing its own oysters and allowing the kitchen to source 90% of its seafood from the waters around Hilton Head. The laid-back vibe extends through the winding dining rooms and expansive outdoor porch. First come, first served. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Links, an American Grill\\n\\n Address: 11 Lighthouse Ln., Hilton Head, SC 29928Phone: (843) 363-8380Website \\n Surf and turf are the primary offerings at this elegant dining room located directly on the Harbour Town Golf Links, but the smartest orders are the specials from chef RJ Dye, a veteran of Fig and The Ordinary in Charleston.

Outdoor seating is available, and reservations are recommended for dinner. \\n \\n\\nHeading: A Lowcountry Backyard Restaurant\\n\\n Address: 32 Palmetto Bay Rd., Hilton Head, SC 29928Phone: (843) 785-9273Website \\n This laid-back outdoor joint is perfect for families and those looking for authentic local flavors.

Reservations are not required, and indoor and patio seating are available. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ombra Cucina Italiana\\n\\n Address: 1000 William Hilton Pkwy., #G2, Hilton Head, SC 29928Phone: (843) 842-5505Website \\n The traditional menu at this restaurant includes classic antipasti like carpaccio (thinly sliced beef) and mussels sauteed in white wine.

              "  'Hong Kong is at once both exactly what you\\'d expect and completely surprising. It\\'s a compact, skyscraper-packed city infused with glamour and energy that also juts up against green open space that\\'s dotted with hiking trails, swimming beaches, and subtropical flora. It\\'s a juxtaposition that is wonderfully refreshing—especially after you\\'ve spent several days immersed in Hong Kong\\'s hectic pace. \\n Thanks to a wonderfully efficient transportation system, you can spend the morning shopping in the Causeway Bay neighborhood and noshing on dim sum in Sheung Wan, before escaping to Big Wave Bay for an afternoon of surf and sun on a tree-lined beach. \\n While exploring Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula is as easy as hopping on a ferry, make sure you don\\'t miss a visit to at least one (if not several) of the city\\'s lesser-visited islands (there are 261 islands in total). Lantau Island may be the largest and the easiest to visit, but Lamma, Cheung Chau, and Po Lin each boast their own often quieter, less touristy feel. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Hong Kong (GMT+8) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The sky might be blue and the weather sunny, but summer in Hong Kong can be overwhelmingly hot and humid.

The services are clean and fast and rely on a fare system that\\'s as cute as it is easy to use (meet the Octopus card). To start, pick up an Octopus card at the airport (the 7-Eleven in the arrivals hall sells them), put money on it, and use it the rest of your trip (including your journey from the airport). When you need to top-up, just stop by one of the many Octopus service providers—including 7-Eleven, McDonalds, Starbucks, and Circle K. \\n Taxis:You\\'ll have no trouble finding a taxi in Hong Kong. In addition to Uber, local red taxis operate in the urban areas, green taxis serve the New Territories, and blue taxis operate on Lantau Island. Taxi drivers use meters so you don\\'t have to worry about being ripped off and fares are cheap compared to other world-class cities. \\n Car service: If you want to arrive in the city in style, consider a luxury car transfer with Hong Kong Car Service.

At the Mandarin, you\\'ll be treated to opulent rooms, a tranquil spa, and a level of service that has become a Mandari trademark. Plus, you\\'ll be walking in the footsteps of dignitaries like Margaret Thatcher and Henry Kissinger, who both stayed at the hotel during trips to the city. \\n Address: 8 Cameron Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong KongPhone: +852 3551 6888Website \\n You don\\'t have to stay at a five-star hotel to experience Hong Kong safely and comfortably. The boutique OTTO Hotel walks the line between affordability and comfort with its simple, clean interiors and tasteful amenities. And thanks to the OTTO\\'s location in Kowloon\\'s Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, you\\'ll be in the heart of Hong Kong\\'s renowned shopping and food scene and steps from the harbor. \\n Address: Salisbury Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong KongPhone: +852 2920 2888Website \\n There\\'s no doubt about it, The Peninsula raises the bar—providing guests with elegant quarters, five-star service, and a location that\\'s hard to top. Sitting on Kowloon Peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island, The Peninsula\\'s dedicated clientele enjoy seven restaurants (including the Michelin-starred French restaurant, Gaddi\\'s), a spa with water views, and upgraded rooms with dreamy floor-to-ceiling windows. \\n Address: No. 246, Queen\\'s Rd. E., Wan Chai, Hong KongPhone: +852 3926 3888Website \\n Hotel Indigo\\'s rooms are stunning, but the hotel\\'s true appeal is found in its common spaces and exteriors: a bronze dragon made of solar fins wraps the building and a dramatic, glass-bottomed infinity pool juts out over the street. You can sit on the rooftop bar and look out over the impressive city or swing by Indicolite Restaurant for a menu of local favorites crafted with a clever twist. \\n Address: 14 Shek Tsai Po St., Tai O, Hong KongPhone: +852 2985 8383Website \\n Hong Kong may be known for its modern feel and high-rise hotels, but it\\'s an entirely different world at the Tai O Heritage Hotel. In this historic, colonial-style building (which was once a police station) on Lantau Island you\\'ll be perched above the historic Tai O, a prized Hong Kong fishing village. With well-appointed rooms and a boutique feel, the hotel offers guests the ultimate homebase for a day of exploring the fishing village or the giant Tian Tan Buddha statue. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Address: 132 Nathan Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong KongPhone: +852 2152 1417Website \\n In a city rich in dim sum, sometimes it pays to stick to the greats; businesses that have been operating for decades and still maintain a loyal following. Sun Tung Lok is one such spot. Opening in 1969, this restaurant earned three Michelin stars in 2011 and continues to operate under two stars. You can order à la carte or rely on the experts and opt for the set menu. Reservations are recommended. \\n Address: 7 Burd St., Sheung Wan, Hong KongPhone: +852 2541 8199Website \\n This little restaurant is so low key, they don\\'t even have a website. But that doesn\\'t deter the shop\\'s loyal diners who come time and again for some of the city\\'s best congee—a type of rice porridge often eaten for breakfast in Hong Kong. You won\\'t need a reservation, but come prepared to wait for your own steaming bowl of goodness, which is known for having a superior texture. \\n Address: 49 See Cheung St., Sai Kung, Hong KongPhone: +852 2792 9966Website \\n Seafood is a must in Hong Kong and one of the best places to try fresh, traditionally prepared seafood in Hong Kong is Loaf On. The Michelin-starred eatery is quick and casual (no reservation needed), but you\\'ll leave full and happy. Try the chili and garlic mantis shrimp. \\n Address: 1/F, The Peninsula Hong Kong, Salisbury Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong KongPhone: +852 2523 5464Website \\n When you need a break from Cantonese cuisine—and want to dine in style—head to Gaddi\\'s in The Peninsula hotel. The service is impeccable and the dishes are phenomenal. You\\'ll want to book a reservation, especially if you have your heart set on dining at the chef\\'s table in the kitchen (which is a must). \\n Address: 24-26 Stanley St., Central, Hong KongPhone: +852 2696 6763Website \\n Don\\'t get so immersed in the Hong Kong food scene that you forget China\\'s rich tea history. Here at Luk Yu Tea House, you can enjoy Cantonese-style tea alongside your dim sum among old-world decor. \\n Address: 5/F Rosewood Hong Kong, Victoria Dockside, 18 Salisbury Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong KongPhone: +852 5239 9220Website \\n You\\'ll find some of the best food in the world in Hong Kong, including a fresh take on Indian street food. This refined restaurant turns Indian classics into elevated bites that\\'ll transport you to another world (literally). Reservations are recommended and a post-meal cup of the golden chai masala is a must. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n Address: Star Ferry Pier (also called Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier), Hong KongWebsite \\n The Star Ferry is as touristy as it gets, but sometimes activities are popular for a reason. The Star Ferry is one of them. In addition to transporting you between the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island, the trip provides you unparalleled skyline views on both sides—especially at night. \\n Address: 128 Peak Rd., Hong KongPhone: +852 2522 0922Website \\n If you\\'re looking for views over the city, nothing beats a trip up Victoria Peak, referred to simply as \"The Peak.\" You can take a bus or taxi to the highest point on Hong Kong Island, but the best views are found from the Peak Tram or the trail that traverses between the MTR Central Station and The Peak Tower. It doesn\\'t matter how you get there, just make sure you do—from the top, you can look down over the sea of skyscrapers (and the sea itself) toward Kowloon. \\n Address: 128 Peak Rd., Hong Kong \\n One of the best ways to get oriented is to walk the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, which stretches from the colonial-era Clock Tower to Hung Hom. And while you can watch the ferries cross the harbor and take photos of the Hong Kong Island skyline during the day, nothing beats a walk on the promenade at night, when a sound-and-light show is projected onto the skyscrapers across the harbor. \\n Address: Ngong Ping Rd., Lantau Island, Hong KongPhone: +852 2985 5248Website \\n It\\'s hard (maybe impossible?) to miss the Tian Tan Buddha on Lantau Island—the giant, bronze Buddha statue tops out at 111 feet. The hike to the statue and the surrounding area are well worth your time, as is a quick visit to the Po Lin Monastery at the foot of the statue. To get to the site, nothing beats arriving by cable car—an extra treat that provides views of the island (and the Buddha) from above. \\n Address: Shek O, Southern District, Hong Kong \\n At first glance, Hong Kong has a distinct urban feel, but travel to the southern side of Hong Kong Island and you\\'ll find the area\\'s natural, subtropical flora. That\\'s why it\\'s worth a trip to Big Wave Bay, a popular surf and beach hangout north of Shek O. On this side of the island, you can hike, surf, or people watch without sacrificing easy access to restaurants (and surf board rentals). \\n Address: Fung Tak Rd., Diamond Hill, Hong KongPhone: +852 3658 9366Website \\n Escaping modern-day Hong Kong is as easy as stepping into Nan Lian Garden. The Kowloon park, which was modeled after the Tang Dynasty style, boasts well-maintained pathways, lotus and koi ponds, and beautiful traditional Chinese architecture. It\\'s a great place to catch your breath, enjoy a snack, and hide out from the hustle and bustle of the city. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Address: 1 Matheson St., Causeway Bay, Hong KongPhone: +852 2118 8900Website \\n The Causeway Bay area is known for its shopping, but no shopping center can top Times Square, a mall with over 200 stores selling everything from electronics and toys to high-end accessories and clothing. \\n Address: Temple St., Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong \\n You can shop the day away at Hong Kong\\'s nicest boutiques, but don\\'t miss a visit to the city\\'s iconic night market, home to street food, cheap clothes, and trinkets. The wares may not be worth writing home about, but the ambiance will be. The busy market in Kowloon is the place to be once dusk settles — just come prepared with enough energy to take it all in. The buzz can be both invigorating and exhausting. \\n Address: 1 Great George St., Causeway Bay, Hong KongPhone: +852 2890 6823Website \\n You can find everything from Chanel to Apple products in the Causeway Bay neighborhood of Hong Kong, but for something truly unique, head to the four-floor Island Beverley shopping center. Here, you\\'ll find local designers and independent retailers offering up their unique (often handmade) wares to passing shoppers. \\n Address: 8 Finance St., Central, Hong KongPhone: +852 2295 3308Website \\n With a location next to the Four Seasons, near the harbor, the IFC Mall is an easy place to swing by (and spend a full day). There\\'s no shortage of high-end shopping, including fashion from brands like Gucci, Chloé, and Valentino and accessories from Bulgari, Rolex, and Tiffany & Co. \\n Address: Great George St., Causeway Bay, Hong KongPhone: +852 2833 0935Website \\n This glitzy, open-air shopping center is the place to be if you have a taste for high-end products and cutting-edge labels. It\\'s all too easy to fill your arms with bags from retailers like Max Mara, Adidas, and Zadig & Voltaire. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Causeway Bay: Don\\'t come to Causeway Bay in search of peace and quiet. Like Tokyo\\'s Shinjuku, this bustling neighborhood is almost always crowded with shoppers coming to take advantage of the myriad shopping malls and boutiques. \\n Wan Chai: You can still catch a glimpse of old-world Hong Kong in Wan Chai, a commercial area on Hong Kong Island that\\'s dotted with casual eateries and bars alongside traditional buildings that show off the island\\'s Colonial-era architecture. \\n Central: To the west of Wan Chai on Hong Kong Island is the Central neighborhood. Arguably the heart of the island, Central is packed with luxury hotels and fancy malls situated in dense skyscrapers. But it isn\\'t all glitz and glam here, Central is also home to some of the city\\'s best nightlife, delicious eats, and the picturesque waterfront. \\n Tsim Sha Tsui: It\\'s near impossible to visit the Kowloon Peninsula without passing through Tsim Sha Tsui, home to Kowloon\\'s harbor, skyscrapers, malls, and eateries that run the gamut from Michelin-starred fine dining to family-owned noodle shops. Sheung Wan: Further west of the Central neighborhood is Sheung Wan, a lively area with a hip, down-to-earth feel. In this corner of Hong Kong Island, you\\'ll find trendy boutiques, laid-back eateries, and the Western Market, which is known for handicrafts and fabrics. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring: Spring in Hong Kong is short—usually considered to fall in March and April. During this brief period, the temperatures tend to average between the mid-60s and early 70s, with precipitation starting to increase after the typically dryer winter. \\n Summer: The weather ramps up in the summer months, with heavy rainfall in June and hot, humid temperatures topping out in July and August. It is during this time that the likelihood of typhoons increases (usually June through October). \\n Fall: In the autumn, temperatures begin to slowly dip, with November typically marking the shift to averages that hover below 70 degrees. During this time rainfall also slows, providing a short, but wonderful window of time that\\'s perfect for tourists looking to explore the city.Winter: Hong Kong has a subtropical climate; even in the middle of winter, temperatures don\\'t average much lower than 60 degrees. The winter months are also when precipitation levels slow. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n MTR: Public transportation map and route planningiOs | Android \\n Uber: Ride hailing appiOs | Android \\n Google Translate: Language translation with offline capabilitiesiOs | Android \\n OpenRice: Searching local restaurants, ordering takeaway, and booking table reservationiOs | Android \\n',\n",

              "  'Makito Umekita/Travel + Leisure \\n Iceland has become one of the top adventure travel destinations in the world. Though, in many respects, it still feels like a well-guarded secret. Perhaps that\\'s because of its bountiful natural resources, empty roads that wind through the vast volcanic landscape, or the swaths of open land with nothing but wild horses and waterfalls for miles. \\n Not surprisingly, most travelers come to seek out the stunning natural beauty —\\xa0 from Skógafoss to Thingvellir National Park — and are ready for adventure. To that end, ecologists and environmentalists recommend not eating puffin or whale — sometimes presented to tourists — and following the leave no trace rule. That means taking all of your trash with you and sticking to marked paths to avoid harming the precious ecosystem. \\n Besides unimaginable scenery, Iceland provides a wealth of local culture. It\\'s known for having warm hospitality and a strong national pride in its history and mythology. Reykjavik, the capital and largest city brims with museums, churches, cozy restaurants, and bars. Icelanders are quite friendly and helpful. It’s the most peaceful country in the world, according to a recent Global Peace Index report, and the crime rate is extremely low. All this makes it an excellent destination for worry-free solo travel. \\n Ready to plan an epic trip to the land of fire and Iceland? Scroll on for expert-approved picks for the best places to explore, eat, drink, and stay. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n A spa lover\\'s dream, The Retreat at Blue Lagoon Iceland ranks among the most upscale and relaxing stays in the country. On the pampering side of things, it has an award-winning subterranean spa for mind-body treatments and a private lagoon fed by healing, geothermal waters. Guests also get to enjoy morning yoga, Icelandic coffee time, Michelin-starred dining, and modern suites. \"The property is a great choice for the end of an Iceland trip,\" said Susmita Baral, Travel + Leisure\\'s travel editor. \"Not only is it a great way to relax and indulge in self-care before returning home, but it\\'s also just 20 minutes from the airport.\" \\n The Reykjavik Edition is a luxury hotel right in the heart of downtown. In addition to a prime location, the newly built property possesses contemporary rooms and a sleek spa with a hammam, steam room, and sauna. Ryan Connolly, owner and a guide for Hidden Iceland, suggests heading up to the rooftop bar in the winter months for cocktails, a lively atmosphere, and a chance to spot the northern lights on a clear night. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n Surrounded by the remote, untouched wilderness of Iceland’s central highlands, the newly minted Highland Base at Kerlingarfjöll supplies the ideal home base for adrenaline-fueled adventures. There are special packages for northern lights chasers and snowmobile enthusiasts. After all the thrills, tuck into a cozy sanctuary with neutral decor, sweeping views, and protection from the elements. \"Whether you want to explore the outdoors or stay in, this hotel is truly a cozy base,\" said Baral. \"There\\'s even an underground passageway so you can access the restaurant and other parts of the property without stepping foot outside.\" \\n If you’ve ever dreamt of glimpsing the northern lights from the comfort of bed, Panorama Glass Lodge in southern Iceland will turn those fantasies into reality. “The tiny cabins in the middle of nowhere are completely made of glass and come with both private hot tubs and saunas to warm up on cold days and nights,” says Kyana Sue Powers, Iceland expert and travel advisor. \\n Courtesy of Hotel Rangá \\n Imagine staying at the base of a volcano! Hotel Rangá boasts such a unique location that it\\'s almost always booked at the height of the season. Available tours emphasize the beauty of the stars and northern lights as well as the luxurious experience of geothermal baths. It’s also a great launchpad for outdoor activities such as hiking and kayaking. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Christopher Larson/Travel + Leisure \\n The most popular tourist route in Iceland, the Golden Circle is an easy path between three stunning, famous natural spots: Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir geothermal area, and the Gullfoss waterfall. You can either drive or arrange a guided tour. \\n nicolamargaret/Getty Images \\n Located in northern Iceland, the Diamond Circle has four primary stops: Lake Mývatn, Dettifoss waterfall, Ásbyrgi glacial canyon, and the fishing town of Húsavík (home to the Húsavík Whale Museum). Such scenic and cultural wonders make it one of Iceland\\'s most popular sightseeing routes. \\n Tours of Iceland’s south coast typically begin in either Reykjavik or Vík and bring travelers to many striking natural sights — namely the famous Eyjafjallajökull glacier and Skógafoss, a towering waterfall that often produces a rainbow on sunny days. Other highlights include the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, Seljalandsfoss waterfall, Sólheimajökull glacier, and Reynisfjara black-sand beach. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n While Iceland brims with rugged adventures, it’s also a great place for relaxing. Situated in a lava field near Grindavík, the Blue Lagoon is a bucket-list geothermal spa that’s famed for its mineral-rich waters and mud. It’s the perfect spot to spend the day soothing sore muscles and unwinding. (Pro-tip: If you don\\'t want your hair feeling like straw, be sure to lather it in conditioner when you\\'re changing at the property.) \\n Ratnakorn Piyasirisorost/Getty Images \\n One of the most unique features of Iceland, the natural ice caves form in late fall, gleem blue all winter, and melt in the spring. “This makes each visit truly unlike any other,” says Connolly. Due to the rough terrain and the need for glacier safety training, it’s essential to go with a guide. “KatlaTrack offers tours to the best and most accessible ice caves every year.” \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n One of the best and most unique dining experiences in Iceland, Michelin-starred OX Restaurant serves flavorful fine dining dishes in an intimate, 16-seat counter setting. “The chef doesn’t just prepare incredible food with local products but also shares the story of where the ingredients came from and the inspiration behind the dishes,” adds Connolly. \\n Hailed as the best new restaurant in Reykjavik by both critics and diners, Oto is a rather unique concept. “On paper, a culinary fusion of Japanese and Spanish influences made with Icelandic ingredients sounds quite unconventional. I’m this case, thinking outside the box results in some exceptional sharing dishes,” says Connolly. “Don’t forget to try the cocktails and mocktails.” \\n Tucked inside the old Zimsen building, a former store built in the 19th century, the Fish Company feels at once contemporary and cozy — a style also reflected in the seasonally influenced menu. Chef Lárus Gunnar Jónasson whips up gourmet fare with an emphasis on local seafood and other fresh Icelandic ingredients. \\n You have to take a 45-minute ferry to the Westman Islands to reach Næs (pronounced like \"nice\"). “I make the trip time and time again because it’s such a lovely place with delicious food,” says Powers. “The sweet tomatoes and stracciatella alone are well worth the journey. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n The perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or savor a spectacular post-spa meal, the Michelin-starred Moss Restaurant occupies the top floor of the Blue Lagoon Icelandic ingredients shine in wildly creative ways through chef-prepared coursed menus — including a vegan option. \"Every course was delicious,\" said Baral, \"But I will say the cod crisps were addictive — light, crispy, and flavorful. It was created to use the entire fish and minimize food waste.\" \\n Powers advises to “ask for a tour of the wine cellar, where world-class vintages are held underground in an alcove between volcanic rocks.” \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n Iceland is a country of extremes in many ways. The best time to visit really depends on what you’re hoping to see and do. Peak viewing season for the northern lights stretches from September through March, but the country also gets quite cold then and daylight only lasts about five hours. Connolly also steers visitors away from attempting to navigate Route 1 between mid-October and mid-April. \"Regardless of how good or skilled of a driver you are, it’s about changing weather and road closures.” \\n The period between early June and late August brings temperate weather for visiting countless natural wonders. Travelers should be advised to bring a sleeping mask — at the height of summer, the sun stays up until the middle of the night. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Icelandair and PLAY operate low-cost direct flights between many major U.S. airports and Reykjavik. You can usually score a deal, which makes a trip to Iceland — or a multi-day stopover on the way to another European destination — an economical (and exciting) option. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Towns and Cities to Know\\n\\n Reykjavik: Vibrant, welcoming, and gorgeous, Reykjavik is the capital and most popular tourist destination in Iceland. This makes sense given that it’s the largest city, close to the airport, and in the middle of some of the most famous landmarks. \\n Kridtin Wongpoovarak/Getty Images \\n Akureyri: Sometimes referred to as the “capital of the North,” Akureyri is a port city at the base of Eyjafjörður Fjord that’s home to Akureyri Church, the Akureyri Botanical Garden, and some of the best whale watching in the world, plus \\n Húsavík: Most people visit Húsavík to see Húsavíkurkirkja, the iconic wooden church built in 1907. Travelers will also enjoy the geothermal baths and Húsavík Whale Museum. \\n Höfn: Primarily known for scenic views of the Vatnajökull glacier, the largest ice cap in Europe, the fishing town of Höfn in southeast Iceland also supplies shoals and beaches that make it a popular film location. \\n Vík í Mýrdal: A village of just 300 people, Vík í Mýrdal (or just Vík) ranks among the most popular stops on the Ring Road for those taking the south coast sightseeing route. Two of Iceland\\'s most iconic waterfalls — Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss — sit between Reykjavik and Vík, making the two-and-a-half-hour drive more than worth it. On clear days, the Eyjafjallajökull and Mýrdalsjökull glaciers are visible, too. However, the biggest draw is without question the black-sand beach of Reynisfjara. \\n Ísafjörður: Surrounded by sweeping vistas, Ísafjörður hosts Iceland\\'s popular musical festivals — the Ísafjörður Rock Festival and Við Djúpið Music Festival.\\xa0\"If you make it here, definitely visit Tjöruhúsið for a meal,\" said Baral. \"The restaurant serves the daily fresh catch in a family-style buffet in the warmer months.\" \\n Vestmannaeyjar: A volcanic archipelago off Iceland’s south coast Vestmannaeyjar (or the Westman Islands) is accessible by ferry. It’s a must-visit to see some diverse wildlife — including puffins and Beluga whales. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Iceland has one main highway, called Ring Road or Route 1. As you might expect based on the name, it goes all the way around the island country. Many of the most famous and beautiful natural wonders sit along or near this route. Most travelers start in Reykjavik, the city closest to Keflavík International Airport (KEF), and either rent a car and do a self-drive itinerary or arrange a multi-day tour through one of the many local operators. Within the capital, it’s possible to utilize the public bus service or take a shuttle to attractions such as the Blue Lagoon. \\n',\n",
              "  \"There is nowhere in the world quite like Istanbul. Spread across two continents, Istanbul is a city of layers and contrasts. With historical sights like the Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace brushing up against buzzing bars and lively cafes, with Ottoman-era mosques a short walk from contemporary art museums and galleries, with traditional carpet shops around the corner from trendy boutiques, Istanbul is a city of old and new coexisting. The city never stops moving. \\n Istanbul is the cultural capital of the country, with a plethora of independent galleries and inventive restaurants, as well as its transit hub, with flights going all over Turkey and all over the world. Each neighborhood has its own distinct identity and vibe, and it's easy to spend weeks in Istanbul without ever seeing everything. But that is what makes it so fascinating—there will always be something calling you back for more. So order a cup of Turkish coffee and a piece of pistachio baklava, and get ready to delve into this fascinating metropolis. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Turkey's time zone is GMT+3 year-round, and is also called TRT (Turkey Time). Turkey does not do daylight savings. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) are the perfect times to visit Istanbul, when the weather is bright and mild. During the month of April is the city-wide Tulip Festival, when the parks and green spaces in the city are bedazzled with the colorful bulbs. In the summer, the city becomes sticky and very hot, and most residents flee to the beaches in the south as soon as they can, but the streets are alive all night when the air cools off a little. Winter is gray and rainy, showing Istanbul at its most moody and evocative. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n The main language in Istanbul is Turkish, though with a large international presence in the city, don't be surprised to hear chatter in English or Arabic or Farsi as you explore. Turkish people are generally quite helpful, even if you don't speak any Turkish, and shop owners (especially in Sultanahmet, the historic center) will often invite you to sit down and share a çay, a tiny tulip-shaped cup of strong black tea. Personal space is often a luxury in this crowded city, so don't be surprised if you feel someone is standing too close to you as you wait for a bus or in a line—it's normal here. \\n Don't mistake the water that bisects the city for a river. The Bosphorus Strait connects the Sea of Marmara (and, by extension, the Mediterranean) with the Black Sea, and is therefore a major global shipping route. It's not unusual to see massive container ships floating by your commuter ferry. \\n While Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, the capital city is actually Ankara, in central Anatolia. But the palaces that dot the Bosphorus, left over from Istanbul's status as the capital of the Ottoman Empire, might make you think otherwise. The politicians might do their business in Ankara, but Istanbul feels like the center of the world. \\n Currency: Turkish Lira (TL) \\n (Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: TurkishI don't speak Turkish: Türkçe bilmiyorum.I'm lost: KayboldumCan I have…?: …alabilirmiyim?Where is…?: ... nerede? \\n Calling Code: +90 \\n Capital City: Ankara \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Intricate interlocking transportations—both official and informal—make it easy to navigate around Istanbul. There are multiple metro lines with clear signage and modern cars that connect to an above-ground tram line and two funiculars. The Marmaray, a cross-continent metro line that passes under the Bosphorus Strait, connects the metro system on the European and Asian sides of the city, and has recently expanded to run all the way into the suburbs on both sides of the city. Otherwise, the best way to cross from Europe to Asia and back is by ferry, with multiple ferry lines running between stations on a regular schedule all throughout the day. \\n The gaps are filled by city buses, which are paid for by the same IstanbulKart that gets you onto the metro, Marmaray, and ferries. And if there is no bus that runs to your destination, there might be a dolmuş, a yellow van that runs on a fixed route but stops whenever a passenger requests it and leaves whenever the van is full. There are also light blue minibuses that run on various routes throughout the city. Dolmuş and minibuses are paid in cash, with the price depending on the distance you go. \\n Taxis are plentiful, especially around touristed areas. Apps like BiTaksi can be useful to call taxis directly, and hotels are also usually happy to order a taxi if you can't flag one down. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Ciragan Palace Kempinski\\n\\n Address: Ciragan Caddesi 3234349 IstanbulPhone: +90 212 326 4646Website \\n Housed in an ornate former Ottoman palace on the shores of the Bosphorus Strait, the Ciragan Palace is the ultimate luxurious hotel in Istanbul.

Featuring the work of local designers, creators, and artists, Souq Dukkan is the place to find unique Turkish items from some of the city's most creative minds. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Sultanahmet: Seemingly every block in this neighborhood has something historical poking out. The central square is dominated by the twinned Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque, and the streets hold other imperial Ottoman-era mosques, Byzantine cisterns, and the remains of a hippodrome. This is the main place visitors to Istanbul come, and with good reason—the layered empires that dominated Istanbul have all left their mark right here. \\n Kadıkӧy: Located on Istanbul's Asian shore, Kadıkӧy is the neighborhood of artists and creatives. Bright colorful murals decorate the walls of buildings, while the streets brim with vibrant bars, sleek third-wave coffee shops, trendy boutiques, and al fresco dining. Kadıkӧy has a long stretch of seaside that is filled on summer nights with locals enjoying a beer at sunset. Only a picturesque ferry ride away from the city center, Kadıkӧy is the neighborhood to visit to see how Istanbul's cool kids live. \\n Cihangir: This trendy neighborhood, just a few blocks from Taksim Square, is the place to see and be seen. With cutting-edge boutiques, moody bistros, colorful bars slinging cocktails, and stylish cafes, Cihangir has long been the scene where hip Turks and foreigners mingle. \\n Beşiktaş: Located on the European Bosphorus shore just a short walk from Dolmabahçe Palace, Beşiktaş is a rowdy neighborhood famed for its passionate support of the local football team and its plethora of pubs. Explore the rollicking side streets spilling over with people enjoying the night time energy. \\n Karakoy: Formerly a forlorn strip of shipping warehouses and camping shops, the Karakoy neighborhood has blossomed in the last decade into a colorful strip of restaurants, boutiques, and art galleries. One building houses five of Istanbul's premier private galleries, while mere steps away is the splendid Kılıc Ali Paşa Mosque and its luxurious hammam. \\n Nişantaşı: For luxury and high-end experiences, Istanbul's elite come to upscale Nişantaşı. Here's where you can find haute couture boutiques, luxury brands like Prada and Louis Vuitton, and elegant restaurants. Just nearby is Maçka Park, one of the few parks in central Istanbul and an ideal place to stroll. \\n The Princes Islands: The Princes Islands, called Adalar in Turkish, are nine islands in the sea of Marmara, with four open to the public. Cars are not allowed on the islands, so it's best to get around by bicycle, by foot, or by horse-drawn carriage. With its charming white wooden houses and lush bougainvillea, the islands are an escape from the city within the city. The four islands (Büyükada, Heybeliada, Burgazada, and Kınalıada) can be reached by regular ferries from the mainland. \\n Balat: The twinned neighborhoods of Fener and Balat, historically home to large Greek and Jewish populations, are some of the most picturesque in Istanbul, with colorful wooden houses lining hilly cobblestone streets. Balat has erupted in recent years, easily claiming its place as one of Istanbul's most interesting up-and-coming neighborhoods. Explore the antique shops that dot the area or stop at one of the many cafes and new restaurants that line the streets. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Winter: Istanbul winters are gray and constantly rainy, with weather hovering around 45°-50°F. While it's not ideal weather, the city is evocative and somehow cozy, with vendors selling roasted chestnuts on the street corners and steaming tulip-shaped cups of tea on offer at every restaurant. \\n Spring: In the springtime, the sun comes out and the weather warms up to a comfortable 65°-70°F. Flowers bloom all over the city, from fragrant jasmine to hot pink petals bursting from Judas trees. The early end of spring can still be a little chilly, but everyone still sits outside to soak in the sun. \\n Summer: The long, sticky, crowded days of Istanbul's summer usually have temperatures around 85°F with 70% humidity. The saving grace is the water that surrounds the city—the breeze off the Bosphorus on a transcontinental ferry ride or a swim in the Sea of Marmara from Istanbul's islands takes the edge off the muggy heat. And the endless summer nights, often spent sitting around a long meyhane table sipping a cold glass of anise-flavored raki, make it all worth it. \\n Fall: Autumn in Istanbul is warm and comfortable. The humidity comes down, as does the temperature, lingering around a comfortable 65°F in the early autumn and slipping around to 60°F in the later part. This is the best time to come to Istanbul. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n BiTaksi: Local taxi-hailing appiOs | Android \\n Uber: International taxi-hailing appiOs | Android \\n Trafi: Live traffic updatesiOs | Android \\n Moovit: Transportation schedule aggregatoriOs | Android \\n\",\n",

Jaipur\\'s nickname is a nod to the pink buildings within its historic core, among them the iconic Hawa Mahal. \\n Jaipur is also continuously named one of the best cities in the world by Travel + Leisure readers. A city of sprawling palaces, it\\'s also home to ornate architectural masterpieces and sweeping views of lush green hills and idyllic lakes. It is the first planned city in India and has earned UNESCO World Heritage status for setting an exceptional example of indigenous city planning. And its streets feel a little more manageable than the congested labyrinths of New Delhi and Mumbai, especially for first-time visitors to India. \\n This is a city that inspired Paul McCartney to write \"Riding into Jaipur\" and became the backdrop of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies. It is a place to enjoy the performing arts, to feast on sumptuous meals in the banquet halls of royalty, and to reminisce about a bygone era of Maharajas. Ride elephants and explore Mughal architecture by day and enjoy some of the world\\'s finest hotels by night. \\n Jaipur is also a shopper\\'s paradise, offering everything from fine jewelry and intricate handmade art pieces to a variety of textiles. \\n Visitors can fly directly into the city or take a train, bus, or private car from New Delhi.

              "  'Often called \"America\\'s Playground\" or \"Sin City,\" Las Vegas is an iconic U.S. town known for over-the-top fun. The Las Vegas Strip is all about neon lights, casinos, lavish hotels, and restaurants helmed by some of the world\\'s best chefs. Whether you\\'re heading to Las Vegas to celebrate, gamble, take in a Cirque du Soleil show, or catch your favorite musician\\'s residency, you\\'ll find it in the city where visitors go all out for entertainment. \\n When planning a trip to Las Vegas, think about the type of atmosphere you\\'re after. Each hotel offers a unique scene, with different culinary offerings, architectural styles, and forms of entertainment. Do you want to take your kids to the Tournament of Kings at Excalibur on your way to the Grand Canyon, or are you planning a trip with your girlfriends and booking a suite and cabana at the ARIA? Vegas has something for every taste, and it\\'s a matter of honing in on the restaurants, shows, bars, and hotels that most appeal to you. Whether you\\'ve scored Lady Gaga tickets and a reservation at Elio, or you\\'re keen on trying your luck at the Mirage casino, there\\'s no wrong way to do Vegas. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time (Daylight Savings Time observed) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n While there\\'s no bad time to go to Sin City, keep in mind that daytime temperatures in the summer climb well into the 90s and 100s which can be a deterrent (unless you\\'re planning to spend time poolside or in an air-conditioned casino). Weatherwise, the best months to go to Las Vegas are March, April, May, October, and November. August, the hottest month in Las Vegas, is one of the least expensive times to go. \\n As for events to keep in mind when planning a trip to Las Vegas, a myriad of conventions and festivals happen throughout the year. The most important events to have on your radar are: major tech conference CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in January, music festival EDC (Electric Daisy Carnival) in May, and the Las Vegas Golden Knights\\' hockey season which runs from October to April, with playoffs in May and sometimes into June. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n The bus operating on the Las Vegas Strip is called the Deuce.

              "  'Lima is way more than a layover on the way to trekking Machu Picchu. Perched on cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Lima is one of South America\\'s most animated and culturally colorful cities. Beach meets business center in this capital coastal city. Skyscrapers compete for the best views of thrill-seekers paragliding from the Miraflores cliffs and surfing world class breaks. The pulsing restaurant and bar scenes have evolved way beyond ceviche and Pisco Sours—though you shouldn\\'t skip either. Bohemian neighborhoods attract modern artists and hold Inca ruins. Lima is it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Peru Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Thanks to the Pacific Ocean coast location below the equator, there are only two distinct seasons in Lima: winter and summer. The weather isn\\'t dramatic and rain is rare, but days are usually cloudy and cool. Expect the warmest temperatures and biggest crowds between December and April. For events, February hosts both Carnival (don\\'t miss Lima\\'s Water Wars) and National Pisco Sour Day on the first Saturday of the same month. National Ceviche Day is usually at the end of June. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Peruvian Sol \\n Language: Spanish, Quechua, AymaraI don\\'t speak Spanish: No hablo espanol/castellano.I\\'m lost: Estoy perdido.I would like…: Me gustaria... \\n Calling Code: +51 1 \\n Capital City: Lima \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The Lima Metro has one line with 26 stations, and generally serves commuters who live in the suburbs over tourists.

Combis are cheaper van-size buses that barely slow down to drop passengers off wherever they want on the route. \\n Taxis: Both car and moto taxis are available.

The paved cliffside path runs in three connected segments along the Pacific-facing edge of stunning Miraflores. Parks, sculptures, cafes, restaurants (and a lighthouse) are plentiful if you need a break from looking out over the cliffs. If you want to paraglide, this is your chance. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Larcomar\\n\\n Address: Malecon de la Reserva 610, Miraflores 15074, Lima PeruPhone: +51 1 625 4343Website \\n Both Peruvian locals and foreign tourists love the sea-front shopping, 3D cinema, restaurants, discos, and bowling at Larcomar.

Barranco is beloved for its nightlife and boho-artistic vibes. But don\\'t sleep on Barrio Chino\\'s charming Chinese architecture and abundance of Chifa (Peruvian-Chinese) restaurants. The Historical Center is worth exploring too, with its cathedral-fronted Plaza de Armas, Moorish balconies, and the historic El Gran Hotel Bolivar. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n The weather in coastal Lima almost always plays nice—but cloudy days are typical and temperatures err on the cool side thanks to cold water currents in the Pacific Ocean. Remember, summer and winter are opposite of what we experience in the United States. \\n The warm season is generally from December through April, with temps rarely exceeding the mid 80s. Expect cool, humid, and cloudy weather from June to October. Rain is scarce throughout the year, but sea mist (called guara) is typical. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n CityBike Lima: Bike share payment, bike routesiOs | Android \\n SpanishDict Translator: Grammar check, dictionary, audio translatoriOs | Android \\n Cabify: Order private cars, reserve private cars, payiOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'Lisbon is arguably Western Europe\\'s most underrated capital city. It\\'s also one of the continent\\'s oldest. First founded as a trading port city in 1200 B.C., Lisbon pre-dates Rome. Most of the old city was destroyed in an earthquake in 1755. But today, the \"City of Light\" is thriving. In the last 50 years its population and annual visitors have more than doubled as the rest of the world discovers what this second city on seven hills has to offer.Indeed, Lisbon checks all the boxes. It\\'s home to colonial architecture, destination museums, and even its own genre of music. Hop on an iconic yellow tram and explore a fortified castle, a bustling waterfront, or a colorful maze of cobblestone streets. There\\'s fun food – think themed trucks and even cereal bars – and fine food – five Michelin-star restaurants. At night, retire to a funky hostel, beautiful boutique property, or a 16th Century five-star hotel. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n GMT during the winter (last Sunday in October – last Sunday in March) \\n GMT+1 during the summer (last Sunday in March – last Sunday in October) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Lisbon is a shoulder season destination. The best time to visit is in the spring, March to May, or fall, September to November, when the weather is pleasant. During the winter months, it\\'s often cloudy or raining, and the city can feel like a ghost town. During the summer, peak tourist season, temperatures can be uncomfortably hot, crowds are common, and it can be hard to find accommodations (plus rates are higher). \\n However, you\\'ll definitely want to visit mid-June if festivals are your thing. Sunday, June 13 is St. Anthony\\'s Day – Lisbon\\'s most beloved holiday and an entire night filled with parades, dancing, and plenty of grilled sardines. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro \\n ($1 USD = .83 EUR; Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: Portuguese \\n I don\\'t speak Portuguese: Nao falo portugues \\n Where is the…: Onde está \\n Thank you: Obrigada \\n Learn more Portuguese phrases \\n Calling Code: +351 21 \\n Outlets: Portugal uses type F and type C plugs. The U.S. uses type A and B. So, pack an adapter or be prepared to buy one at the airport.

Tickets can be purchased at stations, online, or on the Comboios de Portugal app. The metro (Metro Lisboa) is just as user-friendly. There are four colored lines. The red line goes all the way to the airport, and single rides cost less than €2. Don\\'t forget to validate your tickets before boarding and hold on to them until your ride is over. \\n Buses: Lisbon\\'s bus system (Carris) runs 24/7 and includes two electric trams (including the historic yellow trolleys) and a funicular. Single rides are €2. \\n Taxis: Lisbon\\'s taxis are abundant and certainly affordable, unless you use them during rush hour. Fares depend on where you\\'re going, what time of day you\\'re going, and how much luggage you have with you. Coop Taxis tend to be the most trusted. Always have cash available as credit cards aren\\'t always accepted. Rideshare: Uber and Cabify, a Spanish rideshare company often cheaper than Uber, are both available here. Upon arriving at the airport, follow signs for the Uber pickup location. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The One Palácio da Anunciada\\n\\n Address: Rua das Portas de Santo Antão, 112-134, 1150-268 Av.

Legend has it the secret recipe for Pasteis de Belem\\'s best-selling sweet custard tarts came from within the Jerónimos Monastery. There\\'s usually a massive line, and sometimes it can take a while to get a table inside. But it\\'s always worth the wait. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Tapa Bucho (Portuguese)\\n\\n Address: Rua Diário de Noticias n 122 1200-281 Lisbon, PortugalPhone: (351) 91-456-6392Website \\n It\\'s hard not to go to town at this tapas bar where there are at least four kinds of croquettes centered around proteins like oxtail and alheira (all served with amazing aolis) and pisco sours so good they deserve a cult following. Reservations are highly recommended because the terrace is small and tables go fast. Portions are quite generous, for the low prices, so keep that in mind as you order. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Barrio Do Avillez (Portuguese, Pizza)\\n\\n Address: R.

It\\'s hard to picture monks taking a vow of poverty in this palatial complex dating back to the 16th century. With its delicate ornate stonework, it\\'s even harder to imagine it surviving the 1755 earthquake, but it did. Several tombs of Portugal\\'s historical elite – from poets to explorers – are found here. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Oceanário de Lisboa\\n\\n Address: Esplanada Dom Carlos I s/nº, 1990-005 Lisbna, PortugalPhone: (351) 21-891-7000Website \\n Although it\\'s not within walking distance of downtown, Lisbon\\'s award-winning aquarium is a must for families and anyone with a remote interest in marine biology.

Garrett 73 75, 1200-203 Lisbon, PortugalPhone: (351) 21-347-6122Website \\n When it opened in 1732, Libraria Bertrand was just another bookstore. Today, it\\'s the world\\'s oldest operating bookstore according to the Guinness World Records. While there are several Bertrand branches in Lisbon, the original is open seven days a week. It\\'s the perfect place to seek refuge from a rainstorm or to find a large selection of books in English. \\n \\n\\nHeading: LX Factory\\n\\n Address: Rua Rodrigues Faria, 103, 1300 – 501, Lisbon, PortugalPhone: (351) 21-314-3399Website \\n LX Factory is Lisbon\\'s answer to DUMBO. Once an industrial site in the shadow of Lisbon\\'s iconic suspension bridge, it\\'s now a hip district home to eclectic stores, galleries, and restaurants. Think food trucks, street art, and cool concept shops selling everything from chocolate salami to funky reversible lamp shades. \\n Gautier Houba/Travel + Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Alfama: Boasting some of the best views of the Tagus River, this medieval village (it survived the 1755 earthquake) is perched on Lisbon\\'s highest hill. It\\'s home to Saint George\\'s castle, and is arguably one of the city\\'s most photogenic neighborhoods. Streets are narrow, but not too narrow for the historic 28 Tram which ferries tourists who don\\'t want to deal with cobblestones or stairs. \\n Bairro Alto: Dating back to the 15th century when artists and authors flocked here in high numbers, this bohemian borough is now a happening scene. But for the most part, the magic only takes place at night. Come during the day to see the Insta-worthy street art. Return after dark for the city\\'s best nightlife, bar-hopping, and dancing. \\n Chiado: It\\'s hard not to compare this sophisticated neighborhood in the center of Lisbon with one you\\'d find in Paris or on the Upper East Side. It\\'s far more contemporary than its surrounding districts and home to luxury retailers, elegant theaters, and the city\\'s finest reservation-only restaurants. It also boasts Livraria Bertrand, founded in 1732 and thought to be the oldest operating bookstore in the world. \\n Belem: Lisbon\\'s most impressive buildings and stateliest parks aren\\'t downtown; they\\'re in Belem. This historic waterfront with an extensive riverside trail was where 15th-century explorers, including Ferdinand Magellan, departed Lisbon to discover the world.

The neighborhood is also home to beautifully landscaped green spaces, the ornate Jerónimos Monastery and several museums. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Lisbon has four seasons and with the exception of summer, a pretty mild climate.

              "  'Ah, London — home to world-class restaurants, an unparalleled music scene, fantastic hotels, and some seriously rich history. Plus, tea. Who could forget the tea? London is a beautiful city to visit, and with England\\'s fantastic public transportation, it\\'s a breeze to get from point A to point B. You could easily spend a week or more exploring all that each London neighborhood has to offer and still have things left over for your next visit. \\n With sites and cultural hubs like the National Portrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square, the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Kensington Gardens, and all manner of food, drink, shopping, history, and culture, it\\'s no wonder why the \\'Big Smoke\\' is a top travel destination. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Greenwich Mean Time during the winter, British Summer Time during the rest of the year (starting at Daylight Saving Time). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n England experiences relatively mild and somewhat rainy weather year-round, and when you should go depends on what you\\'d most like to experience. Spring, summer, and fall allow for taking in the parks and getting the most out of how walkable London is, while winter is beautiful and festive for those looking to get their fill of Christmas markets and traditional cheer. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n London is filled with neighborhoods brimming with great things to do, and England\\'s exceptional public transportation makes it simple and stress-free to travel between them. \\n Londoners, and English people in general, have a much different manner of interacting with one another than Americans do. While an American might think nothing of smiling at a stranger they pass on the sidewalk or asking about work in the first few minutes of a conversation, etiquette in London errs on the more private, respectful, and more distant. Don\\'t mistake this for aloofness or consider those you meet unfriendly; it\\'s just a difference in cultural norms. Instead, talk about things like movies, TV shows, books, your travels, and the like, instead of work or family. \\n A fun and somewhat reassuring fact is that London has much better takeaway sandwiches than the U.S. If your day is too packed to have a sit-down lunch, a sandwich from a chain will be legitimately delicious. Most importantly, almost all British museums are free, meaning anyone can wander to their heart\\'s content, no matter their budget. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Getting around London is unbelievably easy thanks to the well-maintained and extensive Underground (also known as the Tube). Tickets for riding the Underground, unlike American transportation systems, which often pay per ride or per trip length, are paid in zones. Fare also varies based on the time of day and the method you use to pay. It\\'s worth getting an Oyster card — the Underground\\'s MetroCard or SmarTrip Card — to simplify your vacation. \\n There are 11 Underground lines servicing all nine zones. Maps of these zones are in every Tube station. Most of the popular sites in London are in Zone 1, which covers central London. The Tube runs daily from 5 am to midnight and with reduced hours on Sunday. Some late-night services are available on the weekend, but generally, you\\'ll want to be prepared to take one of the easily-found London taxis or use a rideshare app if you\\'re out and about after midnight. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The Savoy\\n\\n Address: Strand, London WC2R 0EZ, United KingdomPhone:+44 20 7836 4343Book Now \\n The only luxury hotel on the River Thames, The Savoy is a five-star experience known worldwide for its luxurious and beautiful accommodations.

Try something new here — don\\'t stick to your usual takeout Pad Thai order (as delicious as Pad Thai is). A crispy omelette, like their delectable Kai Jeow (a crispy omelette with oysters), should do the trick. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Westerns Laundry\\n\\n Address: 34 Drayton Park, Highbury East, London N5 1PBPhone: +44 020 7700 3700Website \\n This beloved, sustainably-focused restaurant focuses on fresh seafood and small plates — and bread.

Try the octopus glazed with harissa oil or the Bayt al Maqdis Chicken just for the artichoke crisps. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Noble Rot\\n\\n Address: 51 Lamb\\'s Conduit Street, Holborn, London WC1N 3NB, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7242 8963Website \\n A seasonal wine bar with a classic British menu, this flashy restaurant puts the \"British food is boring\" rumor to rest. There\\'s a wine for every dish, and more — their list is outstanding, and the bold and unique twists on classic British dishes make this a must-taste spot even for folks for which (gasp) wine isn\\'t that exciting. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Lyle\\'s\\n\\n Address: Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch, High Street, Shoreditch, London E1 6JJ, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 3011 5911Website \\n Lunch is a la carte at Lyle\\'s, meaning you have the opportunity to order and share a few dishes between yourself and your friends and get the best of all worlds. The dinner menu is set, offering a prix fixe three-course meal with a few options for your appetizer, entree, and dessert. The space is beautiful and minimalist — a calm, understated place to focus entirely on your incredible food. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Parsons\\n\\n Address: 39 Endell Street, West End, London WC2H 9BA, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 3422 0221Website \\n A small, sustainable seafood restaurant in Covent Garden, Parsons has an unpretentious, always-fresh menu. Parsons has mastered the art of updating classic British flavors, like smoked eel, for the modern palette. Their fish pie is heavenly, and you\\'d be remiss not to enjoy a sticky toffee pudding if you\\'ve got room for it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Black Axe Mangal\\n\\n Address: 156 Canonbury Road, Highbury, London N1 2UP, United KingdomPhone: No phone number, email only: info@blackaxemangal.comWebsite \\n What this Turkish restaurant lacks in size, it makes up for in personality — up to and including their occult buns (which are hot cross buns, but with pentacles on them). It\\'s loud, but most importantly, it\\'s fun: nothing about Black Axe Mangal takes itself too seriously, from the hard rock soundtrack to the delicious food. Edible glitter, tongue-in-cheek dish names, and an excellent beer list all make Black Axe a top spot for a good time. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Roti King\\n\\n Address: 40 Doric Way, Somers Town, London NW1 1LH, United KingdomPhone: +44 020 4580 1282Website \\n Roti King is in a basement — this is just something to know because otherwise, it might be a touch difficult to find. \"Hidden gem\" isn\\'t a metaphor here: you\\'re going to have some of the best Malaysian food you\\'ve had in some time, possibly ever. If you\\'re having trouble finding the entrance, just look for the line; there\\'s almost always at least a short one of people waiting for their chicken murtabak and char kuey teow. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Dishoom Shoreditch\\n\\n Address: 7 Boundary Street, London, E2 7JEPhone: +44 020 7420 9324Website \\n London restaurant recommendations wouldn\\'t be complete without at least one Indian food recommendation, and to be fair, most places are going to be incredible. Dishoom is something special, though — its airy, Bombay-style decor, beautiful views from the veranda, and house recipes have earned it a dedicated following. As a reminder, chicken tikka masala is sweet in England, so if you want something savory, try a new dish — like gunpowder potatoes or the marsala prawns. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Tower of London & Tower Bridge\\n\\n Address: St Katharine\\'s & Wapping, London EC3N 4AB, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7403 3761Website \\n The bridge most associated with London isn\\'t actually the London Bridge, it\\'s Tower Bridge — this is the bridge you almost certainly have in your mind\\'s eye when imagining London. The Tower of London has an infamous reputation, but its history is even more interesting than most know. Tudor buffs will love tracing the steps of Queen Elizabeth I, and there are free tours given throughout the day. \\n \\n\\nHeading: St. Dunstan in the East\\n\\n Address: St Dunstan\\'s Hill, Billingsgate, London EC3R 5DD, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7374 4127Website \\n Built in 1698, St. Dunstan in the East was once a church. It was firebombed during World War II, and the ruins were converted into a public park — certainly one of the most unique and beautiful. Though small, stepping into the park feels like stepping into another world. Bring a camera; you won\\'t want to miss snapping shots of the ivy-covered ruins. \\n \\n\\nHeading: National Gallery\\n\\n Address: Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross, London WC2N 5DN, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7747 2885Website \\n The National Gallery has one of the most incredible collections in the world, including pieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Monet, Van Gogh, and many, many more. Their 2,300-piece collection is frequently rotated, so be sure to see what sometimes-stored pieces are on display when you go. \\n \\n\\nHeading: St. James\\' Park\\n\\n Address: London SW1A 2BJ, United KingdomPhone: +44 300 061 2350Website \\n Not to be confused with the football (aka soccer) stadium in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, St. James\\' Park in London is one of its most famous, right alongside Buckingham Palace and perfect for a rest during a busy day of sightseeing. It is known for its waterfowl — ducks, specifically, but also a small flock of pelicans. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hyde Park\\n\\n Address: Hyde Park has several entrances, convenient to the neighborhoods surrounding it.Phone: +44 300 061 2000Website \\n Hyde Park is a massive 350 acres, nestled smack dab in the middle of London, and worth a day\\'s focus all on its own. With events, historical monuments, walking tours, and gardens, it is a truly stunning and fun place to be. It\\'s famous for its Speakers Corner, which has been a stage for free speech and debate since 1872. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Shakespeare\\'s Globe Theater\\n\\n Address: 21 New Globe Walk, London SE1 9DT, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7902 1400Website \\n Shakespeare\\'s Globe is a reconstruction of the original Elizabethan playhouse for which Shakespeare wrote his plays, and his entire body of work is rotationally performed. The Globe\\'s performances are heavily influenced by what is known historically as the experience of seeing them in Shakespeare\\'s day, for an immersive experience impossible to find elsewhere. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Highgate Cemetery\\n\\n Address: Swain\\'s Ln, Highgate, London N6 6PJ, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 8340 1834Website \\n Ghost-chasers and history buffs alike will love to walk around Highgate Cemetery, where 170,000 people are buried. It is also a nature reserve, and the entire grounds are lush, beautiful, and feel a bit out-of-time. Notable graves to pay your respects at include Douglas Adams, George Eliot, Karl Marx, Leslie Hutchinson, and many more. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Buckingham Palace\\n\\n Address: Westminster, London SW1A 1AA, United KingdomPhone: +44 303 123 7300Website \\n In the heart of Westminster, Buckingham Palace is a beautiful and awesome (in the traditional sense of the word) piece of architecture and history. You can actually go inside the famed Buckingham Palace — tours of certain rooms in the palace are available. \\n \\n\\nHeading: London Eye\\n\\n Address: Riverside Building, County Hall, South Bank, London SE1 7PB, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7967 8021Website \\n Also known as the Millennium Wheel, the London Eye is the best view of London — it was literally built to be exactly that, and its construction is known as an observation wheel, not a Ferris wheel. It\\'s a touch expensive, but visited by millions of tourists for a reason: the view from the top is absolutely stunning. \\n \\n\\nHeading: St. Paul\\'s Cathedral\\n\\n Address: St. Paul\\'s Churchyard, London EC4M 8AD, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7246 8350Website \\n One of the most recognizable sites in London, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral dates from 1690 and still has most of its original stained glass. It\\'s known for its extensive and stunning mosaics, soaring Gothic architecture, and large, beautiful Cathedral library. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Big Ben\\n\\n Address: Westminster, London SW1A 0AA, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7219 4272Website \\n Everyone\\'s must-stop for a classic London Insta snap, the iconic clock is nearby to other points of interest and featured in most driving and walking tours. Tours of the tower itself are limited to UK residents. \\n \\n\\nHeading: British Museum\\n\\n Address: Great Russell St, Bloomsbury, London WC1B 3DG, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7323 8299Website \\n The British Museum differs from the National Gallery in that it is as much an anthropological museum as an art museum. Collections are organized by era and country of origin, and frequent exhibitions are curated around themes to explore human experiences across ages. Their total collection is estimated to be around 8 million pieces, with many taken out only for specific reasons, so it\\'s worth seeing what special exhibitions are on display. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Westminster Abbey\\n\\n Address: 20 Deans Yd, Westminster, London SW1P 3PA, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7222 5152Website \\n Even people for whom history is not necessarily a thrill, gothic Westminster Abbey is an overwhelming, stunning experience. Every coronation of an English monarch since 1066 has happened here, and the Abbey is the final resting place of Queen Elizabeth I, Elizabeth of York, Geoffrey Chaucer, The Unknown Warrior, and dozens of others. Westminster Abbey also pays homage to great poets, artists, and writers with a series of beautiful memorials. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Covent Garden\\n\\n Address: 14 James Street, London WC2E 8BU, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7420 5856Website \\n Covent Garden is both a neighborhood and a famed market, first established in 1694. The center is the beautiful Piazza, where walking is made easier and more pleasant by the lack of cars. In addition to an array of unique shops, Covent Garden is home to the London Transport Museum, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, and several high-end restaurants. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Borough Market\\n\\n Address: 8 Southwark Street, London SE1 1TL, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7407 1002Website \\n The motto of London markets is: if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it. Borough Market is large and primarily focused on food, and is one of the longest-running in the city. Officially established in the 19th century, there is one area that dates back to at least the 12th — so definitely buy yourself a sandwich and think how pleased your ancestors would be at your bounty. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Foyles\\n\\n Address: 107 Charing Cross Road, Soho, London WC2H 0DT, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 7437 5660Website \\n There are a few equally-convenient locations for the famed, enormous bookstore Foyles, but the flagship — and most impressive — store is in Soho, at Charing Cross. Even folks who wouldn\\'t describe themselves as readers travel to visit Foyles for the sheer scale of it, including the gorgeous architecture and the vast collection of books. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Camden Market\\n\\n Address: Camden Lock Place, London NW1 8AF, United KingdomPhone: +44 20 3763 9900Website \\n Camden Market was established in 1791 and has been charming London and travelers ever since. Near enough to Regent\\'s Park and the London Zoo to walk, Camden Market is full of shops, cafes, nightlife, and live music. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Oxford Street\\n\\n Address: From Tottenham Court Road to Marble ArchWebsite \\n Oxford Street is one of the busiest shopping areas in Europe, greeting about half a million visitors every day across its 300-plus shops. Whatever you\\'re looking for, Oxford Street probably has it. Notable shops include Topshop, Dr. Martens, Flying Tiger, Muji, and Selfridges. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Regent Street\\n\\n Address: From Piccadilly Circus to Park CrescentWebsite \\n Intersecting with Oxford Street is the equally impressive Regent Street, home to the flagship stores for Burberry, Kate Spade, Tory Burch, and more. Regent Street was built to be London\\'s dedicated shopping street, a place for Londoners to get anything and everything they might need. There might be a few more now, but Regent Street is the original — and some might say the best. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Carnaby Street\\n\\n Address: From Beak Street to Great Marlborough StreetWebsite \\n The third in the shopping street trifecta is Carnaby Street. A few streets over from Regent Street, Carnaby is much shorter and largely fashion-focused, especially vintage shops specializing in threads from the \\'60s. Shorter doesn\\'t mean less diverse, though — Carnaby Street is home to over 100 shops, restaurants, and cafes. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Seven Dials\\n\\n Address: Center of St. Giles DistrictWebsite \\n Seven Dials, sometimes considered part of Covent Garden, is truly unique: a circular road junction that has a slower, calmer pace than the rest of London. Seven Dials is named for the seven sundials at its center and is surrounded by about 90 shops and restaurants. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Shoreditch: A trendy neighborhood chock full of vintage shops, cafes, art galleries, and clubs. The neighborhood skews young and boasts everything from artisan coffee shops and fine dining to chain restaurants. Wander around here for some of the best shopping in London. \\n Notting Hill: Yes, that Notting Hill. It\\'s as charming as you imagine it to be. Famed for Portobello Road Market and the antiques and vintage stores that line it, Notting Hill is also home to high-end restaurants, the Ladbroke Square Garden, and some of the most charming and beautiful residential streets in London. \\n Covent Garden: Synonymous with the Covent Garden Market, this much-loved neighborhood is filled with odd little gems like tiny toy stores, bookstores, clothing boutiques, and more — plus an array of restaurants and eateries. Covent Garden is not a mall; it is, truly, a garden, and a lively and beautiful place to sit, have a coffee, and people-watch. \\n Camden: Also known as Camden Town, though no one really calls it that anymore. Home to Camden Market and the famed venue Electric Ballroom, it abuts The Regent with easy walking access to the London Zoo and a bit of a longer walk to Queen Mary\\'s Rose Gardens. \\n Kings Cross: Not only a rail station but a neighborhood, too! Historic Kings Cross Station is a big draw, though, with a photo area for Platform 9 ¾ and a \"Harry Potter\" gift shop right nearby. Kings Cross was once heavily industrial but has been made over with gardens and small green sitting areas. \\n Soho: Lively, theater-dotted Soho in the West End is the place to go for nightlife of all stripes. Take in a show, go dancing, enjoy a late-night movie or dinner, or a few of the above. It\\'s one of the most popular tourist destinations in London, being an easy walk from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery. \\n The West End: The West End is London\\'s Broadway. But don\\'t be fooled — it\\'s not just international stagings of Broadway shows. The West End is a thriving theater scene with original work going up regularly. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n On one hand, the weather in London does not tend to fluctuate between highs and lows, no matter the season. On the other, it rains in London — a lot. About nine to 10 days a month, on average. No matter when you go, pack some waterproof layers; odds are you\\'ll be glad you brought them. \\n Spring: Spring in London, and England as a whole, is beautiful. London is a very green city, and spring brings the parks and gardens to blooming, fragrant life. Early spring can be a little chilly, but it might be worth going then to beat the tourist boom from late spring through summer. \\n Summer: Summer in England is mild and lovely, and London is no exception. Temperatures rarely climb above 75°F. For this reason, it is by far the most popular season for travel, and hotel and flight prices tend to reflect that — however, it\\'s also inherently a bit more lively, with a lot going on. \\n Fall: Again, fall is temperate, with a little more rain than summer. If you want to beat the summer rush but still want warmer weather, you might want to wait until fall for your trip. \\n Winter: Winter can get cold, but not bitterly so; average temperatures rarely fall below 30°F. England is big on Christmas, and holiday markets and cheer abound. If you love the winter holidays, London might be a perfect choice for you — it\\'s hard not to feel festive in the land of A Christmas Carol. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n London Tube Live: Up-to-date info on delays, updates, departure information, and routes.iOS | Android \\n The Pub Finder: Crowdsourced app for pubs and bars, including reviews and tips.iOS | Android \\n London Pass: Free interactive London guidebook.iOS | Android \\n',\n",

              "  'Located at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, Los Cabos consists of three distinct areas: Cabo San Lucas, San José del Cabo, and the coastal highway between them, referred to as the Tourist Corridor. The popular destination is served by San José del Cabo International Airport which is located about three miles from San José del Cabo and about twenty miles from Cabo San Lucas. \\n Los Cabos is a combination of desert, beachfront, and mountain terrain, with the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the peninsula and the Gulf of California, also called the Sea of Cortés, on the east. The warm, dry, sunny climate and beautiful scenery have turned the former fishing village into the home of hundreds of resorts, hotels, and vacation homes from Cabo San Lucas up to a newly developing coastal area north of the airport called the East Cape. \\n Sportfishing, snorkeling, swimming, diving, sailing, and surfing are among favorite water sports, and on land, visitors play golf and tennis, explore the desert and beach terrain on dune buggies, hike, and ride mountain bikes, horses, and camels. Guests enjoy lively nightlife and dine at top restaurants or casual cafés. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Mountain Standard Time, changing seasonally to Daylight Time. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Temperatures are warm year round, with August the hottest month (75 to 92 degrees F) and January and February the coldest (54 to 79 degrees F). For perfect weather with temperatures from the mid 70s to mid 80s as well as a getaway from colder climates, November through April are high season months, and prices reflect the demand. \\n April and May are the driest months with practically no rain at all, and in May and June, the temperatures get well into the 80s, and you\\'ll probably want to be near a beach or pool enjoying the sunny weather. \\n Late July, August, and September are the warmest months with higher humidity, and the wettest months are August and September averaging about two to three inches of rain. Hurricanes are possible during those months, but they are relatively rare. For avoiding crowds and high prices, a late summer visit could be worth considering. \\n Whale watching season runs from about December through April, with humpbacks frequently seen during that time of their migration. In February, the calves (baby whales) become active. The gray whale season is from January through March. Boat trips to see the whales up close are very popular during that time. \\n The Festival of San José, patron saint of San José del Cabo, takes place from March 14 to 19, with parades, carnivals, dancing, food, parties, traditional costumes, entertainment, and music. Sportfishing tournaments are held in October and November. Music and film festivals, food and wine events, competitions, and religious holidays fill the calendar all year long in Los Cabos. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n The Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortés meet at the southern tip of Baja where El Arco (The Arch), a rock formation, rises from the sea. The surf on the Pacific side is quite rough, and the Sea of Cortés is calm, although there can be strong currents. Before jumping in, be sure you\\'re at a safe swimmable beach. \\n Timeshare sales people at the airport can be quite aggressive as you pass, and drivers will approach offering to take you to your hotel. It\\'s advisable to arrange transportation in advance through your hotel or a reliable local service. \\n Although the currency is the Mexican peso, U.S. dollars and major credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. It is possible to obtain pesos at the airport upon arrival, through ATMs, or at some hotels. \\n Tipping is customary in Mexico at bars, restaurants, spas, and at hotels for assistance with bags or other services. It is considerate to leave something for hotel housekeepers each day. Tour guides should also receive a gratuity. At restaurants and spas, the typical amount is 10-20%. For others, the equivalent of what you would leave in the U.S. is appropriate. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Taxis: Taxis are available at hotels and at the airport. In San José del Cabo, red and yellow taxi vans operate and in Cabo San Lucas, the vans are blue and green—they operate 24 hours a day. From the airport, Los Cabos has an official taxi provider. The fare between the two cities is about $60-$70. \\n Buses: The Suburcabos buses run between Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo every day from about 5:00 a.m. in San José and about 5:20 a.m. in Cabo. They run about every 20 minutes until approximately 9:30 p.m. \\n Airport Transportation: Car rentals, private companies, shuttles, and taxis provide transportation from the airport. Note that Uber is not permitted at the airport, and it is illegal in Cabo, although it may be operating. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: One & Only Palmilla\\n\\n Address: Carretera Transpeninsular, Tourist Corridor, 23400 San José del Cabo, Baja California Sur, MexicoPhone: +52 624 146 7000Book Now \\n This luxe resort features a variety of guestrooms, suites, villas, and casita suites with private infinity pools.

              "  'Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n There\\'s far more to Madrid than bullfighting, flamenco, and tapas, though you\\'ll certainly find all three in the Spanish capital. Named one of the best cities to visit in Europe by Travel + Leisure readers and one of the best places to travel by T+L editors in 2023, there\\'s a little something for everyone in this incredible city. \\n Art lovers can spend the day strolling around Madrid\\'s Golden Triangle of Art, where three of the world\\'s biggest museums meet. History buffs will love the city\\'s gorgeous architecture and historic landmarks, including the oldest restaurant in the world and an Egyptian temple. (Yes, it\\'s actually Egyptian.) And you can\\'t go wrong with the booming food scene here — it\\'s made Madrid one of Europe\\'s best food cities. \\n Madrid offers so much to do that you may want to embrace the tradition of a midday siesta. The city\\'s bars and clubs tend to hit their stride after midnight, so an afternoon nap may be just the fuel you need to transition from a day of sightseeing to a night of music and dance. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n T+L readers voted the 154-room Rosewood Villa Magna the best hotel in Madrid in recent years, highlighting its central downtown location, modern elegance, and incredible wellness offerings. Each spa offering is individualized and combines ancient Iberian practices with newer innovation. For example, guests can sign up for the \"El Retiro\" Sense Journey, which starts with a guided power walk in the park and ends with a leg and foot massage. \\n The Four Seasons Madrid, voted one of the best hotels in Madrid in 2023 by T+L readers, combines seven historic buildings to create a luxury enclave in the heart of the city. The hotel is the Four Seasons brand\\'s first in Spain and sits just steps away from luxury shopping along the famous Gran Via. Plus, there\\'s a rooftop terrace, a pool, and a four-level spa. \\n This intimate boutique hotel boasts just 76 rooms, but its rooftop terrace offers some of the best views in the city. The property is located along the Gran Via, and its restaurant, Ático, is helmed by chef Ramón Freixa of the Michelin two-starred Ramón Freixa Madrid. \"Guests can relax together in the cozy bar area or indulge in the spa when they need to unwind,\" T+L contributor Stacey Leasca previously reported. \\n The centrally located Sleep\\'n Atocha isn\\'t just good for your wallet, it\\'s good for the environment. The hotel has been a carbon-neutral facility since 2019 and has committed to environmentally friendly practices like recycling, purchasing products with a low environmental impact, and using toxic-free\\xa0cleaning products. Its whimsical design and excellent location make this affordable gem a must-stay in the capital city. \\n Located in a 19th-century palace, Only You Boutique Hotel Madrid combines modern design with classic Spanish-style architecture in a 45-room hotel. Guests can dine at the Younique Arts Club, where food and art intersect — both national and international artists host exhibitions in the space. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n Located in the heart of Madrid, Puerta del Sol is one of the city\\'s best-known and busiest public squares. It\\'s home to the famous clock whose bells mark the beginning of the Spanish New Year. \"Look for the marker in the middle of the plaza that marks Spain\\'s Kilometer 0,\" Jamie Ditaranto, T+L contributor, recommended. \"This is the starting point for all the major roads that leave Madrid and head toward all corners of the country.\" \\n Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n The Museo Nacional de Prado is Spain\\'s main national art museum. It \"houses some of the most emblematic artworks of Spain, including Francisco de Goya’s \\'Black Paintings\\' and Valásquez’s \\'Las Meninas,\\'\" Jamie Ditaranto previously reported.\\xa0Along with the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía, the Prado forms Madrid\\'s Golden Triangle of Art. The museum was founded as a museum of paintings and sculptures in 1819 and includes works of art from Spain and beyond. \\n The Royal Palace of Madrid is among the largest and most opulent palaces in Europe, boasting more than 1.45 million square feet of space spread over 3,418 rooms. Guests can spot paintings by famous artists like Francisco Goya and Diego Velazquez in the opulent rooms. Stop in to see the world\\'s only complete Stradivarius string quintet and, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, catch the changing of the Royal Guard. \\n Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n Plaza de Cibeles is the public square home to the iconic Cibeles Fountain, which was built in 1782. This spot is surrounded by four pieces of legendary Spanish architecture, including the former post office that now serves as Madrid City Hall. \\n An Egyptian temple may be the last thing you would expect to find in Madrid, but that\\'s exactly what the Temple of Debod is. This Egyptian temple traces its history to the 2nd century B.C. It was given to Spain by the Egyptians and moved to Madrid, where it was rebuilt stone by stone and opened as a tourist site in 1972. If you\\'re looking to soak in a gorgeous Madrid sunset, this is one of the best places to do it. \\n Read More: 30 Best Things to Do in Madrid, From Palace Tours to Flamenco Shows \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n Gran Via is a nearly mile-long retail paradise where shoppers can expect to find a mix of luxury boutiques and mainstream brands nestled among some of the city\\'s architectural gems. Retailers along the Gran Via include H&M, the Real Madrid Official Store, the Atletico Madrid Official Store, and the largest Huawei store in Europe. \\n Operational since 1740, El Rastro is an open-air market\\xa0that sells everything and anything — from knick-knacks and antiques to clothing and furniture. It\\'s open every Sunday and on public holidays and is located on Calle de la Ribera de Curtidores. \"The market can get very crowded,\" Stacey Leasca previously noted, \"but if you\\'re feeling overwhelmed, you can step off to one of the shops lining the street behind the stalls to find a little space.\" \\n Rory Fuller/Travel + Leisure \\n Mercado de San Miguel opened as a wholesale food market more than 100 years ago. Today, it\\'s the place to sample everything from Iberian ham to fresh fish and tapas from more than 20 stands serving up delicious Spanish food. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Chocolateria San Gines is a short walk from Puerta del Sol and is one of the most popular places in town to grab churros. The intimate cafe traces its history back to 1864 when it began developing its reputation as an after-theater dessert spot. It\\'s tucked behind one of Madrid\\'s oldest churches and serves up its signature dark hot chocolate and churros around the clock. \\n If you\\'re looking for a memorable dinner, you\\'ll want to reserve at DiverXo. The recipient of three Michelin stars, the restaurant is helmed by chef Dabix Muñoz. \"The collision of ingredients sounded more like a word-association game than a recipe,\" Matt Goulding, a food journalist living in Spain,described in the July 2023 issue of T+L. \"But [my] first bite left no room for doubt.\" A dinner ticket here starts at $380 per person. The restaurant is usually booked solid, but their website opens new reservation slots every day at midnight for the date 90 days in the future. \\n Casa Botin was founded in 1725 and is recognized by\\xa0Guinness World Records as the oldest continuously operating restaurant on Earth. Its signature dishes include suckling pig and roasted lamb, but its menu is full of chicken, veal, and seafood platters, too. Stop in for dinner, or take a tour of Casa Botin\\'s dining rooms, cellar, and underground tunnels. The tour is about $87 and includes a set lunch or dinner menu. \\n Corral de la Moreria is the place to experience flamenco in Madrid. This venue has been hosting live flamenco shows since 1956 and has performances every night of the week. And if it\\'s dinner and a show you\\'re after, there may be no better place. Coral de la Moreria has a Michelin-starred restaurant on-site. Guests over the years have included Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Che Guevara, and Demi Moore. \\n Madrid\\'s food scene isn\\'t a Spanish-only affair. Peruvian chef Roberto Martínez Foronda combines Peruvian and Southeast Asian ingredients and flavors at his restaurant, Tripea, which opened in 2017. “The fusion boom in Madrid created so much bad food,” Foronda told T+L in the July 2023 issue. “But we’ve cut through the fat, and what’s left is mostly excellent.” For a little more than $53, guests can try Foronda\\'s eight-course tasting menu. \\n Read More: How Madrid Became One of Europe\\'s Best Food Cities \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Madrid is a city that sizzles during the summer, with temperatures that can soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Brave the heat for Madrid\\'s take on Pride, which starts each year in late June and runs through early July. What used to be a small celebration in the late 1970s has since grown into one of the largest celebrations of LGBTQ+ pride in Europe. \\n For better weather, fewer crowds, and more affordable prices, try visiting during the fall or spring. The days are sunny, and you\\'ll be able to celebrate events like the San Isidro Festival, held each year in May, and the\\xa0Autumn Festival\\xa0(or Feria del Otoño), held in October or November. \"[The Autumn Festival draws] acts from all over the world, from opera and ballet to theater and indie music,\" Stacey Leasca, a T+L contributing editor, previously reported. \\n Read More: The Best Time to Visit Spain for Great Weather and Famous Festivals \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Madrid-Barajas Airport\\xa0is in northeast Madrid and services most major airlines.

              "  'Packing for Maine is sort of like packing for an adventure: You\\'ll want to bring your sturdiest boots and most weather-resistant jacket, and the kind of bag that has room for fresh blueberries. Scenic Maine is known for its relaxed New England lifestyle, not so much the mansions of Greenwich or Newport as the earthy, sea-dashed homes that look like they\\'ve got stories. Bring your flannel, your favorite Stephen King novel (for the full experience of Maine\\'s most famous resident, of course), and a taste for lobster, and you\\'ll be ready for anything. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Maine gets cold in the winter, so unless winter is your favorite season and you are a big fan of the cold (no judgment here), summer and fall are the best times to go. While summer is peak tourist season and allows visitors to enjoy all that Maine\\'s beaches and seafood have to offer, fall might even win out — the weather is usually brisk and comfortable, and the New England fall foliage can\\'t be beat. In fact, Maine has entire events planned around its famous foliage: Harvestfest in York, Fryeburg Fair, OgunquitFest, and more. Craft fairs are extremely popular during the fall throughout Maine, so if your favorite part of traveling is discovering unique treasures, you\\'d be hard-pressed to find a season to visit better than autumn. And, of course, there\\'s Halloween. Though not as popular a New England destination as Salem, Massachusetts, or New England neighbor Sleepy Hollow, New York, Maine nonetheless does Halloween in style, and fans of the holiday will find themselves among like-minded people. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Maine is a largely laid-back, outdoorsy state. If you\\'re too clipped when speaking to locals, you might come off as uptight — be friendly with your communication and you can\\'t go wrong. Don\\'t eat lobster with a bib, don\\'t ask if the blueberries are local (they are), and get comfortable with small talk, because Maine locals love to talk about the weather. For a state where so much of what there is to do is outdoors, it makes sense. \\n For some local delicacies, try Moxie, a soft drink that can be an acquired taste. Amato\\'s pickles are based in Portland, and have the market cornered in Maine. And, of course, whoopie pies. The very first ones were sold in Lewiston, Maine, and nowhere does them better. \\n There\\'s also a huge antiquing scene in the state, and if you\\'re at all interested in ferreting out some vintage finds, Maine is an excellent choice for you. Almost every town has its own antique shop that folks swear is the best around. Even if you\\'re not an avid thrifter, it\\'s worth checking out some of Maine\\'s most famous antique shops, just for the experience. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Depending on where in Maine you\\'re spending your time, there are a variety of ways to get around. \\n Trains: Amtrak runs a local service known as the Downeaster, which runs from Boston, Massachusetts, to Brunswick, Maine. Hop on for easy transportation to major towns and cities throughout Maine. \\n Buses: There are several bus lines operating throughout Maine, depending on what counties you\\'re in. Greyhound runs throughout, but there are several more localized services that might be better for your needs. \\n Taxis: Taxis are available throughout Maine, but as in most places, you must call a service directly if you\\'re not in an urban area already.Ferries: Maine is serviced by two ferry lines specific to Casco and Penobscot Bays. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Inn by the Sea\\n\\n Address: 40 Bowery Beach Rd., Cape Elizabeth, ME 04107Phone: (207) 799-3134Book Now \\n A skip away from Portland lies the Inn by the Sea, a gorgeous beachfront resort with a full-service spa.

              "  'As compact as Martha\\'s Vineyard is — or simply the Vineyard, as locals affectionately abbreviate it — this New England island can feel much larger because of its three main towns: Oak Bluffs, Vineyard Haven, and Edgartown, all of which offer something different. There\\'s also Aquinnah, renowned for its towering seaside cliffs, the sleepier fishing village of Chilmark, and the less touristy, often labeled \\'residents-only\\', West Tisbury. \\n A visit to the island isn\\'t complete without visiting them all, however, repeat visitors will surely play favorites, flocking back to their preferred destination. Don\\'t be intimidated, there\\'s something for everyone on Massachusetts\\' largest island, and though it may not be the easiest to access, that only adds to its charm — because once you arrive, you\\'ll never want to leave. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Time to Visit Martha\\'s Vineyard\\n\\n A New England island situated seven miles offshore in the Atlantic Ocean, the Vineyard is very much a seasonal destination. Summer is by far the best time to visit with balmy averages hovering in the 80s and a plethora of activities on offer; the winter can bring nasty, coastal storms and the majority of businesses will shutter during these months. If you\\'re planning a trip to Martha\\'s Vineyard in high season, you should book accommodations early (whether you\\'re looking for a luxe hotel or an Airbnb), as space is limited on the 100-square-mile island. \\n Repeat visitors may find that the shoulder-season months — April and September — are the best time to experience all of the island\\'s charm, without the chaos of high-season crowds. And if you\\'re lucky and willing to plan last minute, warm autumns may prompt the Vineyard to extend the season, so don\\'t completely write off October. With that said, if you have plans to visit a specific restaurant or shop during shoulder season, just make sure to check their website for off-season hours. \\n \\n\\nHeading: What to Do in Martha\\'s Vineyard\\n\\n With nearly 20 beaches, the most obvious thing to do on the Vineyard is check out the beaches. Gay Head Public Beach shows off the towering Aquinnah cliffs, Menemsha is known for gorgeous sunsets, and Lighthouse Beach is walking distance from Edgartown. Elevate your beach day with a lobster roll or whole steamed crustacean with a side of seaweed salad from The Net Result. \\n Rent a bike and pedal past the historical Gingerbread cottages of Oak Bluffs. Climb the West Chop Lighthouse or Edgartown Lighthouse for impressive views of the Vineyard. Visit the Flying Horses Carousel, which dates back to 1876. \\n Whether you\\'re wading, paddleboarding, or surfing, playing in the surf is a crucial part of island life. You should also head out on the water for an afternoon, taking a traditional sailing lesson (try private lessons with Sail MV) or chartering a boat for the day (try Island Girl Excursions). \\n Pop into one of the harborside bars with airy decks and tiki cocktails, where you may just stay for the rest of the evening. Visit The Ritz MV for a taste of the island\\'s late-night, local scene — open year-round. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay on Martha\\'s Vineyard\\n\\n Nestled in the former whaling port of Edgartown, The Kelley House Hotel still stands from the days when sea captain wealth developed the island. Don\\'t let 275 years of history fool you, though — Kelley House\\'s 54 rooms have been renovated to keep up with the times, emanating contemporary, nautical charm. The guests-only pool is a rarity on the island and a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the beaches during peak-season. \\n The Christopher, The Sydney, The Richard, and The Edgartown Inn are the four luxury boutiques in this hotel collection, totaling 69 rooms across Edgartown. Each property is tastefully renovated and reflects their own personality, from the island-inspired blue hues at The Christopher to the garden-reminiscent touches at The Edgartown Inn, you simply can\\'t go wrong. \\n Timeless but contemporary, this 117-room resort is at the center of it all, and somewhat of a landmark in its own right, thanks to its ocean-to-plate restaurant, Bettini. The hotel\\'s latest renovation lightened the interiors across a neutral palette of rosy hues and sandstone, accented by pops of seaside blues. \\n Summercamp\\'s Oak Bluffs locale offers a change of pace with its retro-whimsical design elements and mission encouraging guests to \"come be a kid again.\" Amenities like Camp Canteen, with fun, nostalgic snacks (Dreamsicles, anyone?), and a vintage game room with a ping pong table, make this property the ultimate adult summer camp. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get to Martha\\'s Vineyard\\n\\n Accessible only by boat or plane, Martha\\'s Vineyard isn\\'t the easiest island to get to, but the journey is well worth it. Both The Steamship Authority and Hy-Line Cruises run year-round ferries, operating on limited schedules in the off-season (October through March) and increased service during high-season (May through September). The Steamship Authority leaves from Woods Hole, Massachusetts (on Cape Cod) and arrives at Oak Bluffs (seasonally) or Vineyard Haven (year-round) in 45 minutes. The ferry can accommodate cars, however, vehicle reservations are limited and pricey, so many vacationers choose to leave their cars in one of the long-term lots in Woods Hole. Hy-Line Cruises is a passenger-only ferry that also takes about 45 minutes, departing from Hyannis and arriving in Oak Bluffs. Reservations are strongly recommended for both ferry operators, particularly in the summer. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Martha\\'s Vineyard Restaurants\\n\\n Indulging in seafood is a rite of passage on the Vineyard, particularly seafood towers at 19 Raw Oyster Bar. Aim to arrive early and snag a seat on the patio tucked behind one of Edgartown\\'s main drags; slurping local oysters in the sunshine and dipping Jonah crab into cocktail sauce really welcomes you to island life. \\n Only open for dinner, this swanky restaurant specializes in new American fare and inventive craft cocktails. Overlooking Lagoon Pond, the dark-timber bar makes for a lovely sunset perch before moving to your candlelit table.

Appetizers comprise a sort of global tapas, while mains offer fine-dining dishes for every palate, with surf and turf as a longstanding tradition. \\n Even first-time Vineyard visitors will recognize the swinging black lab logo as a symbol of the island, which is why you simply can\\'t miss this classic tavern along Vineyard Haven Harbor. Founded in 1971, this eatery is always overflowing, especially as it\\'s one of the few restaurants open year-round. Don\\'t miss out on the legacy, and while you\\'re there, you may even want to pick up a souvenir shirt, the true proof of a Vineyard visit. \\n',\n",
              "  'Maui is the second largest of the Hawaiian Islands. Its nickname is \"The Valley Isle,\" which describes its geography as a large valley between two dormant volcanoes — Haleakala in the east and Mauna Kahalawai in the west. Haleakala\\'s name means \"House of the Sun,\" and it\\'s the largest dormant volcano in the world at 10,023 feet high, 4,000 feet deep, and 21 miles across its crater. Mauna Kahalawai, an eroded volcano, is referred to as the West Maui Mountains. \\n Maui is known for its beaches, with over 120 miles of shoreline and 80 beaches — more than any other island in Hawaii. Maui\\'s beaches vary from gentle surf to crashing waves, with fine white sand and even rare black and red sand beaches near Hana. \\n Kahului Airport is located in Central Maui on the northern edge of the land between Haleakala and the West Maui Mountains. Five regions define the island. West Maui is home to the resort areas of Kaanapali, Kapalua, and the town of Lahaina. The resort communities of Kihei, Wailea, and Makena are located in South Maui. \\n The road to Hana and Haleakala State Park are in East Maui. Upcountry is located on the higher elevations around Haleakala, where farms, dairies, and ranches take advantage of the volcanic soil and wetter weather. In Central Maui, Iao Valley State Park offers hiking trails, forests, and running streams. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Hawaii follows Hawaii Standard Time (GMT-10 hours), which is five hours behind Eastern Standard Time and two hours behind Pacific Standard Time. Hawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time, so add one extra hour to the time difference during this period (March through November). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The summer season, mainly April through November, sees higher temperatures and less precipitation. June, July, and August are popular with vacationers when schools are generally out, and the weather is warm and dry. \\n Winter, from December through March, is cooler, but still warm and sunny although there\\'s a bit more rain. The weather varies across different areas of the island, and the western and southern shores are generally drier. Lahaina and Kaanapali in West Maui get around 10 inches of rain annually, compared to higher elevations that can see more than 300 inches of rain each year. \\n Winter is a popular time for visitors to get away from cold weather at home and enjoy Maui\\'s mild winter. Whale watching season from December through May, peaking from January through March, is also a great attraction during winter. \\n Read More: The Best Time to Visit Hawaii for Low Prices and Beautiful Weather \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Haleakala is a dormant volcano, but it\\'s not extinct. It last erupted between 1480 and 1600, according to the USGS, and is expected to erupt again in the future. At more than 10,000 feet in elevation, its summit sometimes receives snow in winter. \\n Honokohau Falls plunges 1,119 feet, dropping in two tiers. The tallest waterfall on Maui and one of the highest in the world, Honokohau Falls is located in an inaccessible valley in the West Maui Mountains. A helicopter tour is the best way to see it. \\n Formerly a whaling port and center of the whaling industry in the early- to mid-19th century, Lahaina was the original capital of Hawaii until 1850. \\n Maui is the name of the island as well as the name of a county. Maui County includes the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai, and Kahoolawe. \\n Charles Lindbergh, aviator and explorer, is buried on Maui in a grave at the Palapala Ho\\'omau Church along the road to Hana. \\n The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires a declaration form for each person arriving in Hawaii in connection with rules regarding uninspected plants and animals. When departing, your luggage will be screened for uninspected fruits and plants, but you may take inspected fresh flowers and fruits home. \\n The main airport on Maui is Kahului Airport (OGG), and there are smaller commuter airports in Kapalua and Hana. Molokai and Lanai are served by their own airports. \\n Every year, as many as 10,000 humpback whales travel more than 3,500 miles from Alaskan waters to Hawaii for their winter migration. Maui is one of the best places to see them as they feed, give birth, and nurture their young. Many can be seen from the shore, and whale watching boat cruises are also available. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Language\\n\\n The official languages of Hawaii are English and Hawaiian, although Hawaiian is not commonly spoken. Major resort areas often have customer service representatives who speak Japanese. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n You can get around Maui by shuttle, tour bus, taxi, or public transportation. But to really experience all that Maui offers, you should consider reserving a rental car in advance from the Kahului or Kapalua Airport. \\n The Maui Public Bus system consists of 13 bus routes that provide service in and between various communities throughout the island. All of the routes operate daily including holidays. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: 2365 Kaanapali Parkway, Lahaina, Hawaii 96761Phone: (808) 667-2525 \\n Book Now \\n Steps from the ocean, the hotel has recently opened the Hōkūpaʻa at The Westin Maui, a luxury beachfront tower offering guest rooms, suites, ocean views, and a private lounge with exclusive amenities.

              "  'While Australia\\'s southernmost mainland city seems understated on its surface, visitors quickly learn there are layers of passion, hard work, and history behind every aspect of Melbourne—Australia\\'s cultural capital. \\n Situated on the Yarra River as it flows into Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne and its population of 5 million inhabits a land that has been lived on by Aboriginal Australians for more than 40,000 years. \\n After British settlement in the early 1800s, the wealth produced from the nearby gold rush of the mid-19th century funded the development of much of the city you see today. Magnificent Victorian-era buildings such as Parliament House, The Princess Theatre, and The Block Arcade remain as vibrant today as when they first opened, and compete for attention with the striking geometric newcomers that dot the cityscape. \\n From the Victorian era emerged the city\\'s Hoddle Grid, a layout which created the many laneways now famous for their street art, and alleys that hide world-class restaurants, bars, and boutiques. \\n You\\'ll notice that Melburnians have a lot of obsessions, most notably coffee, sport, and food. This is great for visitors, as it results in a city that constantly strives for the best. It\\'s evident in the espresso-scented laneways, as baristas grind for that perfect espresso; or in the thousands of flavor combinations that come out of kitchens that encompass cuisines from around the globe, thanks to the city\\'s proud multicultural heritage. And it can be heard coming from the hallowed Melbourne Cricket Ground when a 100,000-strong crowd packs \"The G\" for a game of Aussie Rules. \\n Beyond the arts and all these interests that could keep one endlessly entertained, there is the landscape itself—a mixture of grand parks, impressive gardens and beautiful seasides, all which make Melbourne a must on any Australian itinerary. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10 hours) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Melbourne\\'s temperate climate means visitors can comfortably sightsee year-round. Major sporting events (Australian Open, F1 Grand Prix) and festivals take place mainly in the warmer months, between November and March. Much of the city\\'s action moves indoors as days become cooler, but Melburnians adapt to their winter well, switching out sun umbrellas for patio heaters at outdoor cafes and rooftop bars. Melbourne weather has a reputation for occasionally having \"four seasons in one day,\" which should be kept in mind when packing for your trip here. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Australian Dollar(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: English**Visitors will quickly learn that Australians use a lot of slang in their everyday language, often shortening frequently-used words (i.e. \"arvo\" for afternoon, \"avo\" for avocado). \\n Many common words are also different to their US equivalent. Some handy examples:Elevator = liftSidewalk = footpathTrash can = binCell phone = mobileCookie = biscuitChicken = chookLiquor store = bottle shopFlip-flops = thongsSwimsuit = bathersSweater = jumper \\n Calling Code: +61 \\n Capital City: Canberra \\n Tipping is uncommon in Australia. While never expected, it\\'s also seen as inoffensive, should you wish to offer a tip. Exceptional service at a restaurant is an example of a situation in which a tip would happily be accepted. \\n Australians drive on the left side of the road. People here also keep to the left when walking on the sidewalk or standing on an escalator. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n A relatively flat city, much of Melbourne\\'s sites and attractions can be reached easily on foot—many within walking distance of one another. Public transit is ample within inner Melbourne, and the city\\'s iconic trams are easy to find. Taxis and rideshare options are also readily available. \\n Tram: The City Circle line is free and a great way to move around the Central Business District (CBD). Twenty-four routes cover more than 160 miles of track. With the exception of the City Circle, you\\'ll need a myki card to ride a tram, and across all other public transit services. \\n Train: Melbourne\\'s Metro train system includes an underground City Loop, which encompasses the CBD. There are 17 train lines that branch out from the City Loop, which reach further than the tram network, and can often be faster than a tram if journeying more than a couple of miles. \\n Bus: Your myki will come in handy if you find yourself in need of a bus. While trains and trams access most attractions, buses will come in handy for less accessible parts of town. \\n Taxi: 13cabs and Silver Top are the two main accredited taxi operators in Melbourne. You can hail them, phone or book using their respective apps.Ride-share: Uber and Ola are popular ride-share options in Melbourne. Another is Shebah, an all-women service. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The Langham\\n\\n Address: 1 Southgate Ave, Southbank, VIC 3006Phone: (03) 8696 8888Website \\n Overlooking the Yarra River, The Langham offers a luxury stay in an iconic location, with many of the 388 rooms offering views that encompass the city skyline, Flinders Street Station, St Paul\\'s Cathedral and the MCG.

It happens infrequently enough not to affect summer vacation planning, but with that unpredictability in mind, be sure to pack a light jacket or cardigan, just in case. \\n Autumn: March-MayThis time of year can feel like an extension to summer, with plenty of warm, sunny days. Mornings become increasingly crisp as the season draws to a close. Evenings out on the town may require a coat. \\n Winter: June-AugustMelbourne\\'s winters are mild enough to comfortably spend a day outdoors, with the right amount of layers. While Melbourne never sees a snowfall, winter mornings can be cold enough for frost in some areas, with overnight temperatures nearing freezing on occasion. \\n Spring: September-NovemberMelbourne can sometimes be a little slow to come out of its winter, but spring here is typically sunny and comfortable, steadily warming up while remaining cool in the evenings. \\n Below are average temperatures in Fahrenheit.January: 61°F to 81°FFebruary: 61°F to 80°FMarch: 58°F to 76°FApril: 53°F to 70°FMay: 49°F to 64°FJune: 48°F to 59°FJuly: 45°F to 58°FAugust: 46°F to 61°FSeptember: 49°F to 65°FOctober: 52°F to 69°FNovember: 55°F to 73°FDecember: 58°F to 77°F \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n PTV: Melbourne public transport planner, routes, timetables, live updates.iOs | Android \\n National Gallery of Victoria: Navigation aid to the NGV\\'s collections, events, and exhibitions.iOs | Android \\n The Fork: Restaurant, cafe, and bar reservations; reviews.iOs | Android \\n Yalinguth: An augmented-reality experience guided by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders and storytellers that connects visitors to place and history.iOs | Android \\n The Happiest Hour: Guide to happy hours and other deals at local pubs and bars.iOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'Stephanie Pollak/Travel + Leisure \\n Tenochtitlan, el Distrito Federal, la Ciudad de México — Mexico City has been known by many names in its centuries-long history. Home to more than 21 million residents, this sprawling metropolitan area is the capital of Mexico and one of the\\xa0best cities in the world, as determined by Travel + Leisure\\'s reader-voted\\xa02022\\xa0World\\'s Best Awards. \\n \"You can’t understand Mexico without first understanding Mexico City,\" Zachary Rabinor, a T+L A-List advisor and the CEO of Journey Mexico, said. \"The vibrant capital encapsulates the country’s diversity culturally, historically, politically, artistically, musically, creatively, and more. If you want to know what is going on in Mexico, start with Mexico City.\" \\n Museums, cultural experiences, and incredible food can be found around every corner in CDMX. Even if you\\'re in town for a single day, try to balance your itinerary with old and new. Head downtown to admire classic Mexican murals inside the Palacio de Bellas Artes and to grab an elote from a street vendor along the Zócalo, Mexico City\\'s main square. Museum hop through town, stopping at Museo Frida Kahlo, Castillo de Chapultepec, and Museo Soumaya. And once you\\'ve worked up an appetite, get tacos al pastor from a local taquería — it won\\'t be hard to find. And if you can\\'t see everything in one trip, Mexico City will happily welcome you back. Here are our top recommendations for travelers in this incredible capital city. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n The St. Regis Mexico City sits on Reforma Avenue, one of capital\\'s busiest streets and a hub for business headquarters and embassies. It also puts you close to a number of key landmarks, including the iconic Ángel de la Independencia statue and Chapultepec Park. Check out on-site restaurant Diana — named after the fountain of the Greek goddess just outside — for classic Mexican dishes like tuna tostadas, or modern creations like avocado pizza and cauliflower ceviche. This hotel is consistently voted one of the best hotels in Mexico City by T+L readers. \\n Courtesy of The St. Regis \\n On the tree-lined streets of Condesa, you will find Casa Decu, an art deco dream filled with funky tile floors, private patios, and a rooftop restaurant and garden space. The 27-room boutique hotel is pet-friendly and offers continental breakfast each morning.

This historic estate house is in La Roma, one of Mexico City\\'s trendiest neighborhoods, and just blocks from Metro and Metrobús stations and across the street from the cool community space and outdoor garden, Huerto Roma Verde. \\n Las Alcobas, a 35-room boutique hotel, is in the posh Polanco neighborhood, right near Chapultepec Park. It was voted the\\xa0No. 2 city hotel in Mexico\\xa0in\\xa0T+L\\'s 2022 World’s Best Awards, and travel writer Sophie Dodd reported for T+L that her favorite part of the hotel is its bath service. \"I ordered a \\'Jet Lag\\' bath, which meant a staff member came to run the bath for me (a spectacular luxury) and infused it with a sachet of herbs designed to help me relax and reset after the nearly six-hour flight.\" \\n Each accommodation in the eight-room El Patio 77 is named and styled after states surrounding Mexico City. It\\'s an intimate space, occupying an 1890s mansion in the San Rafael neighborhood, and the hotel prides itself on its eco-friendliness, with a rainwater collection system and gray water recycling program. Even some of the furniture is upcycled, giving the hotel an eclectic (yet still luxurious) feel. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Mexico City\\'s Centro Histórico, or Historic Center, is where centuries-old constructions clash with American-inspired skyscrapers, street markets, and more museums than you can count. \"From ancient Aztec times to modern-day Mexico, the square has been an important gathering place through the centuries,\" Rabinor said. \"Within the Zócalo, you\\'ll see symbolic buildings from pre-Colombian, colonial, and contemporary Mexico.\" \\n Highlights here include the Palacio de Bellas Artes, filled with Diego Rivera murals and fine arts exhibitions; the Zócalo and its Metropolitan Cathedral; and Mercado Ciudadela, home to aisles and aisles of craft stalls selling artisan goods. Rabinor also recommends visiting Avenida Francisco Madero, a pedestrian-only street where \"you can best soak in all the energy of the busy capital.\" \\n Get your tickets well advance to tour Casa Azul, which is where Frida Kahlo lived most of her life. Expect to see many pieces of her artwork here, plus rooms left so untouched that it feels like the artist could return at a moment\\'s notice. A ticket to this museum also gives you entry to Diego Rivera\\'s Museo Anahuacalli, a 15-minute drive away. \\n Stephanie Pollak/Travel + Leisure \\n Not even New York\\'s Central Park can beat this green space, a massive urban forest spanning nearly three square miles. The Bosque de Chapultepec is packed with gems, including the Castillo de Chapultepec (the only castle in the Americas ever occupied by European royalty), Museo Nacional de Antropología, and Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo. \\n Arguably the most dazzling museum in Mexico City, with an exterior that twists to the sky and is made of more than 16,000 reflective hexagons, Museo Soumaya houses one of the most impressive art collections in town. Not-to-miss works include Auguste Rodin\\'s \"La Porte de l\\'Enfer\" and \"The Thinker.\" \\n Parque México is sometimes called \"the lungs of the city\" — the tree-lined green space can either be a place to pick up the pace for a good walk, or a place to catch your breath and slow way down. Head to the park\\'s main plaza to watch break dancers, musicians, and quinceñeras collide. When you\\'re ready for a snack, go to Churrería El Moro for delicious ready-made churros and a Mexican hot chocolate \\n Stephanie Pollak/Travel + Leisure \\n Read More: 26 Best Things to Do in Mexico City, From Fine Art to Fine Dining and Shopping \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n If you\\'re looking for handmade goods, Mercado de Artesanias La Ciudadela is the place to go. This market\\xa0in Colonia Centro has ceramics, silver jewelry, wool blankets, and art made from all over Mexico. Be sure to bring some cash, as not all vendors accept credit cards. \\n The Barrio Alameda, constructed in the late 1920s, bills itself as an \"urban meeting point,\" where food, drink, fashion, and art mingle. Shop for vintage clothes, old-school vinyls, and handmade patches from various storefronts, all under one roof. \\n Jorge Castro/Travel + Leisure \\n If you\\'re looking to take a piece of Mexico back home, hit up this gallery for its variety of modern Mexican wares. Whether you opt for an Acapulco chair, hand-felted print rugs, or a monstera-leaf gold lamp, every item can be shipped home for you. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Routinely picked as one of the best restaurants in Mexico City, Contramar serves the freshest seafood in town. Make a reservation beforehand, and be sure to order the tuna tostadas, and pescado a la talla — Contramar\\'s signature snapper, split in half and topped with red chili sauce on one side and parsley sauce on the other. \\n Make your brunch dreams come true at this French-inspired pasterlería near the leafy Parque México. Sip on a cappuccino and people watch from the wide-open windows, or head upstairs, where you can tear open a fresh-baked concha and dig into a steaming plate of enmoladas. \\n Mexico City\\'s historic center has a number of well-known restaurants, but perhaps none as famous as Café de Tacuba. More than one hundred years old, this restaurant has been popular among presidents and artists alike, and is even where Diego Rivera had his (first) wedding reception. If you\\'re looking for a true, traditional Mexican meal, you\\'ll find it here. \\n Get a taste of northern Mexico at Taquería Orinoco, a chain from Monterrey with seven locations. Try tacos de chicharrón, bistec, or al pastor, all served up on flaky flour tortillas. Corn tortillas are an option, too, as is a\\xa0costra, or a crust of cheese layered across the top. Since these taco shops are sometimes open until 4 or 5 a.m., they\\'re very popular with the city\\'s late-night partygoers. \\n Snag a patio spot at Los Danzantes in Coyoacán, one of the best places in the neighborhood\\'s central square to grab a bite and watch as street performers, vendors, and locals pass you by. Here you can try dishes like chapulines (fried grasshoppers) served with queso fresco and guacamole, duck tacos, and squash blossom–stuffed chicken breast. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n Mexico City is always bustling, no matter what time of the year you decide to go. According to Rabinor, the sunniest and driest months are the end of October through March. \\n In late October, you\\'ll see Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations and decor. Orange and pink marigolds pop up all over town, adorning altars to the city\\'s departed. If you check-in before Sept. 15, that\\'s the day that Mexico\\'s president yells out in celebration at 11 p.m. from the National Palace, marking the country\\'s independence from Spain and ushering in further cries (and parties) from locals. If you\\'re looking for a more low-key time to visit, wait until spring, when the purple jacarandas bloom all over town. \\n Rabinor also noted that locals go to the beach during major holidays and in the summer, so while this \"diminishes the local color,\" it also means visitors can enjoy a \"quieter time, with less people and traffic in our famously congested city.\" \\n Related: 15 Best Places to Travel in March \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Mexico City is best reached by flying into its international airport: Aeropuerto Internacional Benito Juárez (MEX). While there are direct flights from U.S. hubs like Los Angeles (LAX), New York City (JFK), and Phoenix (PHX), travelers can get better fares with layovers closer to the border, like the Dallas/Forth Worth area (DFW) and Miami (MIA). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cities and Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Mexico City is a little bit like New York in that it\\'s made up of\\xa0alcaldías, which are similar to boroughs. There are 16 total, but during your stay, you\\'ll most likely only stop through three or four. Each\\xa0alcaldía\\xa0is made up of\\xa0colonias, or neighborhoods. Below are five that are popular with guests. \\n El Centro Histórico: Mexico City\\'s downtown is always bustling, and it\\'s where many of the city\\'s residents go on weekends. You might see protesters in the main square, vendors hawking their wares through the streets, and visitors brunching among the surrounding terraces. According to Rabinor, \"[Centro Histórico is] the beating heart of not just the city, but the entire country.\" \\n La Roma: Filled with fin de siècle mansions, art deco dwellings, and art nouveau–style storefronts, any architecture lover needs to stroll through this colonia. Originally a middle-class residential neighborhood, it was left destroyed after a massive earthquake rocked Mexico City in 1985. Today, La Roma has found new life as a hot spot for artists, 20-somethings, and tourists from all over. \\n La Condesa: La Roma\\'s fancier cousin next door, La Condesa is a tree-lined paradise built for walking. Parque México and Parque España are popular places for residents to relax, and cafés, bookstores, and restaurants abound in this neighborhood. (Note: Rabinor\\'s expert advice to travelers is to remember that \"Mexico City is much more than Roma, Condesa, and Polanco.\")Coyoacán: This is the neighborhood that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera called home, and Coyoacán has built a reputation for itself as a bohemian haven. Don\\'t miss the performers around the main square\\'s kiosco and the Parroquia San Juan Bautista Coyoacán next door – which has a cafe in the back if you\\'re ready to take a break – along with the Mercado de Artesanias and the Mercado de Coyoacán, each selling snacks, artisan goods, and more. \\n Polanco: A trip to Mexico City isn\\'t complete for any shopping lover without a visit to Polanco\\'s Avenida Presidente Masaryk. If that\\'s not your style, a number of Michelin-worthy restaurants like Pujol and Quintonil are just down the road, and the neighborhood\\'s brick-lined streets are just a few blocks from the Bosque de Chapultepec. Rabinor recommends this neighborhood for first-time visitors, noting that it\\'s ideal for \"those who prefer their travel scenery and vibe very manicured and posh.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Cars and bikes: You most likely won\\'t need a car to get around in Mexico City, though it can be more convenient if you\\'re making a day trip to a neighboring town. (Rabinor swears by Waze to manage the congestion and traffic.) You can also rent bikes from the city\\'s Ecobici program, or apps like Dezba. \\n Trains: Mexico City\\'s Metro system is one of the most expansive and affordable in the world. Buy a reloadable card to get around (for 15 pesos, or about 75 cents). This card will work across the city\\'s transit system, and you can load it up in Metro ticket booths or the machines outside Metrobús stations. Each ride costs five pesos, which is roughly 20 cents. Note that both the Metro and Metrobús have women-only cars, and that they usually have separate boarding zones. \\n Buses: In Mexico City\\'s central neighborhoods and wherever the Metro doesn\\'t go, the Metrobús does. They have their own lane of traffic, so they can be faster than taking a car or taxi, and a ride is just six pesos. The city\\'s trolebús functions similarly, while the RTP buses (for Red de Transporte de Pasajeros, or Passenger Transport Network) cost between two and seven pesos. At the same bus stops, you may see non-city buses or vans taking passengers. If you\\'re curious where these go, they\\'ll have their stops scrawled on the windshield. \\n Taxis: It won\\'t be hard to flag down a pink and white taxi in most parts of town. You can also order one by downloading the city\\'s official \"App CDMX,\" available on iPhone and Android. You can use the app to pay with a debit or credit card, but most drivers still prefer cash. \\n Ride service: Uber, Beat, and Cabify are just a few of the rideshare apps in town. (Pro-tip: Rabinor said the quickest and easiest way to get a taxi in Mexico City is Uber.) If Uber\\'s surge rate seems pricey during rush hour, check Beat or Cabify to see if you can find a deal. \\n',\n",
              "  'From the sizzling nightlife of South Beach to the authentic Cuban flavors of Little Havana, Miami offers one of the richest cultural experiences of any city in the United States. Its diverse neighborhoods house everything from world-famous street art to world-class restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and cultural venues. Miami\\'s colorful history is matched only by the vibrancy and verve of the modern global city it\\'s continually blossoming into today. \\n Miami has attracted the world\\'s most daring and creative minds since its evolution from native Tequesta lands to the promising new frontier of railroad tycoon Henry Flagler in the late 1800s. A developing father of Florida, Flagler expanded his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896 and the rest, as they say, is history. \\n Today, Miami is a destination for lovers of art, design, food, shopping, and even the great outdoors.

One of the most lively spots in the city, South Beach is famous for its beaches, outdoor cafes, Art Deco architecture, and sizzling nightlife. \\n Surfside / Bal Harbour: Surfside and its northern neighbor, Bal Harbour Village, are upscale residential areas with shops, hotels, boutiques, and restaurants in a lush tropical setting. Though it\\'s located on the same barrier island as Miami Beach, the area is significantly quieter and more laid-back. \\n Little Havana: Declared a \"national treasure\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Little Havana became the vibrant neighborhood it is today when it began welcoming thousands of immigrants — many of them Cuban exiles — at the turn of the 19th century. Today, its rich Latin culture is well preserved, with soulful Calle Ocho its heart. \\n Little Haiti: On track to become Miami\\'s newest hotspot, Little Haiti offers a colorful dose of the Caribbean and a thriving art scene. Home to many immigrants from Haiti and other islands, Little Haiti\\'s French-Creole culture can be enjoyed in its restaurants, galleries, theaters, and shops. \\n Wynwood: One of Miami\\'s hottest hoods in recent years, Wynwood is the place to see and be seen, especially among the younger set.

Head downtown for a taste of Miami\\'s museums, retail, cultural and event venues, and top-notch hotels and restaurants. \\n Historic Overtown: Miami\\'s historic Overtown district is also one of its oldest. The neighborhood housed the African American workers who built and serviced Miami\\'s infrastructure as it exploded from the ground at the turn of the 20th century. Today, it\\'s home to vibrant culture and ample soul-food spots. \\n Coral Gables: Located southwest of downtown, Coral Gables is a ritzy section of Miami characterized by Mediterranean architecture and streets shaded by massive banyans. It recently underwent a streetscape revitalization to make its downtown more pedestrian-friendly. \\n Coconut Grove: If you\\'re looking for a lavish vibe at a more relaxed pace plus ample green space and a touch of the eccentric, you\\'ll find it in Coconut Grove. Head to the Grove to enjoy shopping, culture, and a picturesque waterfront, all with a bit of bohemian flair. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Miami is located in the tropics, so no matter the time of year, expect warm temperatures and sunshine.

              "  'It\\'s one of the world\\'s fashion capitals, of course, and Milan certainly does style like few other places. Locals walk around impeccably dressed; visitors prance between the shops in the Quadrilatero d\\'Oro, or \\'Golden Rectangle\\' – the streets around Via Montenapoleone which are home to all the best known brands. \\n Sometimes, this feels like the most modern city in Italy. The fashion houses are responsible for a new crop of contemporary art galleries in repurposed industrial spaces: the Fondazione Prada, Armani Silos and Pirelli Hangarbicocca for starters. Then there\\'s the design scene – the Triennale hosts a permanent exhibition on Italian design, and every April, the Salone del Mobile, or Milan Design Week, fills the city with pop-up boutiques and galleries. Even the nightlife is forward-looking – some of the most inventive cocktail bars in Europe are located here.Of course, Milan has history, too. The Duomo – the vast wedding cake of a building that is Europe\\'s second largest church – was started in 1386 (but only completed in 1965, so intricate was the design). The Brera is one of Italy\\'s finest art galleries, showing works from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. And of course, this is the city of Leonardo da Vinci, who worked in the Castello Sforzesco and painted his famous \"Last Supper\" in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Past, present, and – over in the Porta Garibaldi neighborhood – the future. Few cities are as energizing as Milan. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Milan is led less by seasons, more by events. Fashion Week and the Salone del Mobile send prices rocketing, but go right after the events — MFW is usually in late February to early March, and again in September, while the Salone del Mobile is in April — and you\\'ll find the city still buzzing, with special events and exhibits, although hotel prices are down and restaurants are taking reservations again. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: ItalianI don\\'t speak Italian: Non parlo italianoI\\'m lost: Mi sono perso/aHow much is…: Quanto costa...I would like…: Vorrei…How do I get to…: Per andare a...Learn more Italian phrases \\n Calling Code: +39 \\n Capital City: Rome \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Along with Rome\\'s Termini, Milano Centrale is the country\\'s main railway station. From here, high-speed trains will whisk you across northern Italy to places like Venice, Turin and Genoa, and take you down through Bologna and Florence to Rome. \\n Buses: Milan does have buses, but the quintessential method of public transport is the tram, some of which date back to the 1920s. It also has an excellent metro system. \\n Taxis: Taxis are plentiful, with stands at major sites — though you can also use the MiT hailing app. There\\'s a fixed rate from Malpensa airport but fares are metered from closer Linate. \\n Car service: Most hotels can arrange transfers to and from the airports and out to the lakes. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Galleria Vik\\n\\n Address: Via Silvio Pellico, 8, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 8905 8297Book Now \\n It\\'s not every day you get to sleep inside a global icon. The first European outpost of the luxury South American Vik mini-chain, this is right on brand – and you can\\'t top the location, inside the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.

That\\'s the philosophy of the Milano Scala, located behind the opera house.

All rooms have balconies – get one overlooking the tranquil garden. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Mandarin Oriental\\n\\n Address: Via Andegari, 9, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 8731 8888Book Now \\n Location is everything at the Mandarin — you\\'re five minutes from Via Montenapoleone, La Scala, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, and the Brera. Inside, the feng shui-designed rooms offer everything you\\'d expect from the luxury brand, and then some, with high, wide-backed beds clad in textiles for a Milanese look. Sit outside in the tranquil, secret courtyard for an aperitivo or a classic risotto alla milanese — you\\'d never guess you\\'re in the city center — or take a high-backed, curved banquette in the humbug-striped, marble-ceilinged bar. On a semi-private road, with exceptional soundproofing, it\\'s a top notch urban retreat. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Four Seasons\\n\\n Address: Via Gesù, 6/8, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 77 088Book Now \\n You know what you\\'re getting with Four Seasons service-wise; but few of the brand\\'s hotels are as lovely as this, occupying a 15th-century convent in the heart of the Quadrilatero d\\'Oro. Original frescoes, vaulted ceilings, and grand columns dot the public areas, the rooms are unstated elegance, while the cloister borders an idyllic garden. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Costanza Milano\\n\\n Address: Via Lazzaro Spallanzani, 20129 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 393 564 3501Website \\n Will it be the Greenhouse Loft, the Wooden Atelier, or the Pastel Home? This clutch of three apartments around Porta Venezia, northeast of the fashion district, have been beautifully themed. The Greenhouse Loft is a light-flooded former garage, the Wooden Atelier blends a 21st-century, slightly urban aesthetic with a 19th-century beamed building; and the two-bed Pastel Home is a retro heaven. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Magna Pars Suites\\n\\n Address: Via Vincenzo Forcella, 20144 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 833 8371Book Now \\n When is a hotel not a hotel? When it doubles as a perfumery. In fact, this used to be a perfume factory, back when the Via Tortona area was a hub of industry; today it\\'s been transformed into a sprawling 28-room hotel, complete with a boutique perfumery on the ground floor and set around the tree-filled courtyard. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Yard\\n\\n Address: Piazza Ventiquattro Maggio, 820123 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 894 15901Book Now \\n This is one of Milan\\'s most sceney hotels – evenings see locals lining up for entry to its no-reservations, semi-secret bar, and there\\'s a cult pizza joint on the street, too. Beyond the mishmash of antiques and curiosities that only hipsters could pull off, are super-chic rooms. Each is different from the next, though all have something attention-grabbing – like polo mallets hanging over the bed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hotel nhow Milano\\n\\n Address: Via Tortona, 35, 20144 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 489 8861Book Now \\n Via Tortona has gone from industrial hinterland to one of the city\\'s most cutting edge areas. Some of that is down to the hotel, which attracts the design crowd to its outré lobby (think rabbit-shaped seating under orange chandeliers). Rooms are chic, if not so boundary pushing, with feature walls and crisp white furniture. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Osteria con Vista\\n\\n Address: Viale Emilio Alemagna, 6, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 3664 4340Website \\n Dinner doesn\\'t get more romantic than this \"Restaurant with a View\" – a glass box on top of the Triennale museum in Parco Sempione.

Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Nerino 10 Trattoria\\n\\n Address: Via Nerino, 10, 20123 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 3983 1019Website \\n The suits all around you are here for the set business lunch, but you\\'re here for the a la carte menu and its signature dish: turanici al pomodorino fresco in forma di grano. You\\'ll gasp as the server wheels out a stove-topped trolley, sautées baby tomatoes, pasta and basil leaves in front of you, and serves it in a wheel of grana padano cheese. Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Botanical Club\\n\\n Address: Via Tortona, 33, 20144 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 3652 3846, +39 02 423 2890, +39 02 2951 9342Website \\n From the chrome-topped, plant-drenched bar to the fiery house-distilled gin, you\\'re in for a treat. But this is a bar where you come to eat as much as to drink – come in the evening for a raw fish menu (try the mezcal- and yuzu-marinated yellowtail). There are two other locations in the city but this, on trendy Via Tortona, draws a great after-work crowd. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ceresio 7\\n\\n Address: Via Ceresio, 7, 20154 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 3103 9221Website \\n The rooftop of a nondescript office block is the setting for this restaurant belonging to the founders of Dsquared2.

Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ratanà\\n\\n Address: Via Gaetano de Castillia, 28, 20124 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 8712 8855Website \\n If you\\'re in town for the famous risotto Milanese – swirled with parmesan, saffron, wine, and butter – this converted cinema is the place to try it, with some bone marrow on the side. Chef Cesare Battisti is a master of the Lombardy classics; the business lunch is very popular with locals. Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Marchesi 1824\\n\\n Address: Via Santa Maria alla Porta, 11/a, 20123 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 862 770, +39 02 9418 1710Website \\n This historic pasticceria is such a Milanese icon that it was bought by the Prada Group. The original is a beautiful wood-lined bar on the way to the Last Supper, where little has changed since its 1824 opening. It\\'s great for breakfast; but for lunch, you need the outlet above the Prada store in the Galleria Emanuele II, where you can nibble on delicate tramezzini (sandwiches) while observing the crowds on the mosaicked floor below. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Osteria del Treno\\n\\n Address: Via S. Gregorio, 46, 20124 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 670 0479Website \\n Before it was a fashion capital, Milan was an industrial city. This is a snapshot of its past: an osteria near the Stazione Centrale, which was originally the place for railway workers\\' lunches. Today, it\\'s part of the Slow Food movement, serving modern Lombardy dishes sourced from small producers. Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: La Ravioleria Sarpi\\n\\n Address: Via Paolo Sarpi, 27, 20154 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 331 887 0596Website \\n Milan has perhaps Italy\\'s most multicultural restaurant scene. While it sounds like a pasta shop, Ravioleria Sarpi is part of that – it\\'s a hole-in-the-wall for dumplings (ravioli, as the Italians call them), in Italy\\'s largest Chinatown. There\\'s a slow food approach, too – the top-notch meat is sourced from a local butcher. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Fioraio Bianchi Caffé\\n\\n Address: Via Montebello, 7, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 2901 4390Website \\n You wouldn\\'t necessarily put a florist and a restaurant together, but once you\\'ve been here you\\'ll wonder why nobody\\'s done it before.

Taking inspiration from the time he spent in Asia, owner and chef Pietro Leeman plays with the food, producing different dishes from the same ingredient. Go for the tasting menus, if budget allows – the 11-course Zenith shows you what the restaurant is all about. Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cantine Isola\\n\\n Address: Via Paolo Sarpi, 30 angolo, Via Arnolfo di Cambio, 1A, 20154 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 33 15 249Website \\n The most important thing to know about this wine bar and shop is that it\\'s been going strong since 1896.

On Tuesdays it\\'s poetry night, and every month there\\'s a special event to toast the opening of a new arrival. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Carlo e Camilla in Segheria\\n\\n Address: Via Giuseppe Meda, 24, 20141 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 837 3963Website \\n This could be a stage set – an old sawmill, its concrete skeleton left almost as it was abandoned, only with grand chandeliers slung from the ceiling and designer chairs around a gigantic communal table which seats 70. Celeb chef Carlo Cracco is at the helm – try the meat slow-roasted in the Josper oven. Reservations recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Bar Luce\\n\\n Address: L.go Isarco, 2, 20139 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 5666 2611Website \\n You don\\'t just come to the Fondazione Prada for the art; you come for Bar Luce, the in-house café designed by none other than Wes Anderson. The setting\\'s his signature style – a 1950s mix of mint green counters, Liberty-style lighting, and out-there wallpaper. Order one of the dozens of gourmet panini. \\n \\n\\nHeading: 1930\\n\\n Address: Ripa di Porta Ticinese, 43, 20143 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 3956 2875Website \\n This is a secret bar – but a genuinely secret one. The location is strictly underwraps, and there\\'s no password – the only way in is to score an invite from the staff at sister bar MAG Café. Once you do, you\\'re in for a treat, with cocktails so inventive that the outfit feels like a theatrical production. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Duomo di Milano\\n\\n Address: P.za del Duomo, 20122 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 361 691Website \\n Milan\\'s gothic Duomo – the largest church in Italy after St Peter\\'s – is such an enormous, intricate project that it took 600 years to complete. Take the elevator to the rooftop terraces, where you\\'ll not only have prime city views but also get a close up of the hundreds of sculptures that dot the wedding cake-like structure. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Brera Gallery\\n\\n Address: Via Brera, 28, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 72263 230Website \\n This is one of Italy\\'s big-hitter galleries, up there with the Vatican Museums and Florence\\'s Uffizi.

During the day, you can get a guided tour of the opulent interiors; or to dig a little deeper, take a guided visit to the Ansaldo Workshops, where sets and costumes are designed and built. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cenacolo/Last Supper\\n\\n Address: Piazza di Santa Maria delle Grazie, 2, 20123 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 9280 0360Website \\n This is it, perhaps Italy\\'s most famous single work of art: Leonardo da Vinci\\'s \"Cenacolo\", also known as the \"Last Supper\", frescoed on the refectory wall in Santa Maria delle Grazie church. Try to disentangle yourself from its reputation, and forget \"The Da Vinci Code\"; instead, spend time soaking up the extraordinary atmosphere. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Castello Sforzesco\\n\\n Address: Piazza Castello, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 8846 3700Website \\n Da Vinci came to Milan to work for ruler Ludovico il Moro, whose HQ was this imposing moated castle in the city center. Don\\'t miss the Sala delle Asse, frescoed as a trompe l\\'oeil forest by Leonardo himself. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Navigli nightlife\\n\\n It\\'s no Venice, but Milan\\'s network of canals – the Navigli – is a tranquil haven in the city center. The waterfronts are famous for their bars – and since they\\'re pedestrianized, with plenty of outdoor seating, this is one of the best places in the world for a bar crawl. Stroll along and take your pick – we like MAG Café and Rita & Cocktails. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Milano Grand Tour\\n\\n Phone: +39 02 3676 5705Website \\n Elesta Travel\\'s mission is to draw you away from the \"Last Supper\" and Duomo, and show you some of the lesser known highlights of this city of hidden beauty.

The main complex hosts boundary-pushing temporary exhibitions, while the glass-walled Tower contains works by artists from Damien Hurst to Jeff Koons. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ride a Tram\\n\\n Rarely is public transport as fun as it is in Milan, where the rattling tram network has rolling stock dating back to 1927 as well as retro trams from the 1950s onwards. The routes cut through the historical center and then circle it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Pirelli Hangarbicocca\\n\\n Address: Via Chiese, 2, 20126 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 6611 1573Website \\n It\\'s worth the 30-minute metro ride out to this breathtaking modern art space owned by the Pirelli tire company. The enormous former train sheds have incredible rotating installations which interact with the space itself, but there\\'s nothing quite like the permanent installation, Anselm Kiefer\\'s \"Seven Celestial Palaces\": hulking concrete towers with biblical names, which were designed especially for the hangar. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Triennale\\n\\n Address: Viale Emilio Alemagna, 6, 20121 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 7243 4244Website \\n This sleek 1930s building in the middle of Parco Sempione now hosts Milan\\'s Triennale – a once-every-three-years exhibition on design and art, exploring themes such as man\\'s relationship with a changing planet.

Step through the ancient Casa degli Atellani to the peaceful garden, and, beyond it, a small vineyard planted with Leonardo\\'s grape, the Malvasia di Candia – found through genetic research on the roots. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Bosco Verticale and Piazza Gae Aulenti\\n\\n Address: Piazza Gae Aulenti, 20124 Milano MI, Italy \\n The Bosco Verticale, architect Stefano Boeri\\'s two \\'living\\' apartment blocks covered in trees and foliage, is one of Milan\\'s most famous buildings. It\\'s the heart of the ultra-modern Porta Garibaldi district – view it from Piazza Gae Aulenti, a modern, circular square stuffed with public art and high-end stores. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Parco Sempione\\n\\n Address: Piazza Sempione, 20154 Milano MI, Italy \\n This is one of Europe\\'s great city parks, starting at the Castello Sforzesco, running past the Triennale and ending at a triumphal arch that\\'ll make you wonder if you\\'re in Paris – only this pseudo Roman arch celebrates peace, not war. There are sculptures by the likes of Arman and Giorgio de Chirico. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cocktail bar crawl\\n\\n Milan has one of Europe\\'s most inventive cocktail scenes. Start with the zany Nottingham Forest, which kicked it all off; go on to Bamboo Bar in the Armani Hotel for brand-themed drinks; take in \"wunderkammer\" Tencitt, headed up by master mixologist Morris Maramaldi; and finish at The Doping Club, the semi-secret bar at The Yard Hotel. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Quadrilatero d\\'Oro\\n\\n Address: 20121 Milan, Metropolitan City of Milan, ItalyWebsite \\n For many, this is Milan. The city\\'s Quadrilatero d\\'Oro, or \\'Golden Rectangle,\\' is one of the world\\'s most famous fashion districts. Stroll Via Montenapoleone (or Monte Napoleone) and the streets that feed off it for world-class window shopping. Don\\'t miss the Bottega Veneta Home store, which sits in a frescoed 18th-century palazzo. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II\\n\\n Address: P.za del Duomo, 20123 Milano MI, ItalyWebsite \\n Only in Italy can a shopping mall be a historical monument. The 19th-century mall in the form of a cross is a bombastic glass-roofed, mosaic-floored and sculpture-laden building, with smart bars and designer brands (though the Quadrilatero d\\'Oro is a more rarefied atmosphere if you\\'re wanting to shop). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Fratelli Bonvini\\n\\n Address: Via Tagliamento, 1, 20139 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 53 92 151Website \\n This historic printing shop near the Fondazione Prada was rescued from closure by a group of Milanese (including the founder of Moleskine) who couldn\\'t bear to see it go. You\\'ll find everything from vintage Olivetti typewriters to small-press books, handmade stationery and fancy fountain pens. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Via Tortona\\n\\n Address: Via Tortona \\n On the southwest outskirts of the city, this was once an industrial area, then abandoned – and today has been rejuvenated by creatives drawn to its warehouses. Amongst the factories-turned-office blocks converted by the likes of Matteo Thun for businesses including Armani, you\\'ll find the odd designer outlet and local designer – but come during Fashion Week or the Salone del Mobile when it becomes a pop-up hub. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Il Meneghello\\n\\n Address: Corso di Porta Ticinese, 53, 20123 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 339 739 7608Website \\n Osvaldo Meneghazzo reckons he\\'s the last artisan tarot card maker left on the planet – which is fitting, because they were said to be invented in Milan in the 15th century. As well as creating his own decks – the cat-themed one is particularly good – he recreates historic sets from the Renaissance, which noble families would commission. \\n \\n\\nHeading: 10 Corso Como\\n\\n Address: Corso Como, 10, 20154 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 2900 2674Website \\n Fashion editor Carla Sozzani\\'s store-café-hotel almost single-handedly made the Porta Garibaldi neighbourhood trendy.

Siblings Marco and Paola, and Marco\\'s son Mauro, work from an apartment block in the city center. \\n \\n\\nHeading: NonostanteMarras\\n\\n Address: Via Cola di Rienzo, 8, 20144 Milano MI, ItalyPhone: +39 02 7628 0991Website \\n No, you haven\\'t got the address wrong; ring the bell of this residential block and you\\'ll be buzzed into a beautiful courtyard filled with trees and flowery bowers.

The bar does a mean aperitivo – sit back with your spritz and work out what artwork you\\'d like to take home. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Brera: The cobbled streets of Brera have always had a boho feel, thanks to its most famous resident, the Brera art gallery. Things are rather less louche and rather more chic these days, but it\\'s still a languid, almost Parisian area, with tables lined up outside bistros, little boutiques, and the city\\'s botanical gardens. \\n Quadrilatero d\\'Oro: The \\'Golden Rectangle\\' – also known as the Fashion Rectangle – is one of the world\\'s greatest style districts. Via Montenapoleone is its spine; the roads fanning off it, such as Via della Spiga, Via Borgospesso, and Via Gesù are equally glam. If the most you can stretch to is a coffee, settle down to people-watch at Pasticceria Cova. \\n Porta Garibaldi: This jagged, gem-shaped area north of Brera, looks firmly to the future – its glass-fronted skyscrapers jostle with the famous Duomo to dominate the city skyline. This is a big shopping area, taking in upmarket high street labels, plus niche brands such as influencer Chiara Ferragni\\'s store, and fashion hub 10 Corso Como. Past the famous Bosco Verticale is Isola, once a quiet working class district known for its jazz clubs, now getting ever trendier. \\n Porta Genova: The area behind the Porta Genova station is Milan\\'s classic nightlife zone. Young people crowd the waterfront bars of the Navigli canals; beyond that, and a little hipper and quieter, is the Via Tortona neighborhood, whose former factories now hold bars and boutiques catering to the design-led offices in the area. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Milan springs start crisp and end warm, with May temperatures nudging up to the 70s. Summers are sweltering – although temperatures in the mid 80s don\\'t sound much, add in the humidity and closeness of the Po Valley, and you\\'ll be suffering. Fall is still warm, but temperatures drop sharply in November, with temperatures above freezing in winter, though feeling colder thanks to the humidity. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n BikeMi: City bike schemeiOs | Android \\n MiT (Milan in Taxi): Taxi-hailing appiOs | Android \\n ATM Official: Public transport routes, timetables and ticketsiOs | Android \\n WiFi Lombardia: Single access to the region\\'s public wifi connectionsiOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  \"They call Montana Big Sky Country. Once you make the trek here, you'll understand why. Untamed rivers run for hundreds of miles, teeming with trophy trout, cutting through the corrugated peaks that loom large along the horizon. Through the thicketed forests, world-class hikes lead to hot springs, geysers, and glaciers in every direction. The powder-packed skiing of winter is rivaled in magnitude by the whitewater rafting of summer. Everything is, well, bigger. To enjoy it all, you need nothing more than a rugged sense of an adventure — and a sensible travel plan. The former is up to you, but we can certainly supply the latter. Your ultimate guide to Montana exploration is below. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit Montana\\n\\n The short answer is whenever you want. When you should arrive in Montana is entirely dependent on what you want to do. If you're more inspired by winter sports, world-class ski resorts such as Big Sky and Moonlight Basin are smothered in snow from early December through mid-April. For those motivated by hiking, hot springs, and fly-fishing, June through September is a dependable time to pack your bags. However, if you want to avoid the crowds — especially in national parks like Glacier and Yellowstone — don't sleep on the shoulder season of late summer and early autumn. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do in Montana\\n\\n Although Montana is an unparalleled paradise for outdoor enthusiasts, it still has plenty to offer by way of cosmopolitan delights, especially within the hip college towns along the western part of the state. Over the past decade, Bozeman has come into its own as one of the coolest mountain towns in the U.S. You can enjoy craft cocktails in dimly lit speakeasies like the Devil's Toboggan, or chow down on stuffed quail and other farm-fresh delicacies at Blackbird. Or, spend time in Missoula and soak up the sensational local beer scene at Conflux Brewing Company or Cranky Sam Public House. Either way, if you're looking to enjoy the nightlife — or a pub crawl — during your time in Montana, make sure you're booking a stay in one of these two destinations. \\n If you're more interested in camping out under the stars, Montana is in no short supply of options. Big Sky Country, it turns out, affords plenty of dark sky, completely devoid of nocturnal light pollution. A great way to experience it all is through the expansive state park system. Flathead Lake is an underrated gem here. It's the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi and a wonderful summer getaway for boating, swimming, and fishing, offering a multitude of pull-up campsite options. \\n While up this way, in the northeastern reaches of the state, you'll want to devote some time to strolling the quaint resort towns of Kalispell and Whitefish. And if it's between late June and early October, you'll definitely want to plod through Glacier National Park along the aptly named Going-the-the-Sun Road. Just beware that traffic along the route can be intense throughout this time of year. \\n Further south in Bozeman, the surrounding Gallatin Valley acts as the entry way to Yellowstone. Although the nation's first national park is primarily located in Wyoming, many of its five million annual visitors come by way of this part of Montana. Come in the summer and you can book world-class whitewater rafting adventures through the three river systems that ultimately converge to form the Missouri River. \\n Fancy an unforgettably epic road trip? Traverse the 69 miles of Beartooth Highway between Red Lodge and Cooke City. Crescendoing atop a wide plateau 11,000 feet above sea level, this legendary section of U.S. Route 212 is among the most picturesque stretches of highway in the country. But if soaring, vertigo-inducing heights aren't your thing, head an hour west of Bozeman and delve downward into the Lewis and Clark Caverns — one of the biggest limestone caves in the country. \\n Arrive in winter and you can survey the snow-capped terrain aboard a Ski-Doo. West Yellowstone serves as the snowmobile capital of the lower 48 from December through March. If you prefer to plow through the powder with actual horsepower, check out Big Sky, where you can charter sleigh rides that are sure to enchant the entire family. At the end of an action-packed day, relax your weary bones and soak up the scenery from the region's heralded hot springs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay in Montana\\n\\n When it comes to overnight options, they are as varied as they are abundant, from primitive pull-up campsites and RV parks with mini golf to dude ranches and luxury boutiques with a bit of history. \\n If you're craving a high-end hideaway, the town of Big Sky has emerged as the go-to destination. Home to its eponymous ski resort for nearly 50 years, only in recent years has the luxury set spread its wings here. Lone Mountain Ranch is a stellar standout, and high in the running for best resort in all of Montana. The property features stand-alone log cabins along gently moving creeks. You can do guided yoga in the morning and horseback riding in the afternoon. At the base of the slopes, the Montage just opened the doors to its 139-room ski-in, ski-out resort. \\n For rustic charm further north in the state, book a stay at The Lodge at Whitefish Lake, nestled between its namesake lake and the 28-acre Viking Creek Wetland Preserve. Its thoughtful amenities — hot tubs, spa, live music — are overshadowed only by its access to unspoiled wilderness. \\n Back in the cities of Bozeman and Missoula, boutique hotels are finally becoming part of the landscape. Notable among them is the new Kimpton Armory, a refurbished property from the WWII barracks of the Montana National Guard. With 122 guest rooms, three restaurants, a rooftop pool featuring unimpeded views of the Bridger Mountains, and its own concert venue, it's quickly becoming the place to be in downtown these days. \\n But if you're seeking a more laid-back bed-and-breakfast feel, Montana has you covered in every corner. For those looking for lodging in Missoula, a sensational example can be found at Blue Mountain — five private rooms set atop 20 acres of wildlife habitat directly next to Lolo National Forest. With Big Sky comes big options. Choose wisely. \\n\",\n",
              "  'Mustique is one of 32 islands that make up St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Mysterious by its somewhat out-of-reach nature, Mustique is privately owned and operated, and there are no direct flights from the U.S. or Europe. It has a reputation for being an if you know, you know destination, often visited by the celebrity elite. Aside from its beautiful beaches, cerulean water, and largely untouched landscape, it may be hard to pin down what keeps A-listers coming back to this three-mile-long stretch of paradise. \\n Read on to discover what\\'s behind Mustique\\'s enduring appeal and how you can plan a visit to see for yourself. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Local Vibe\\n\\n Visitors largely come from the U.K., but the island has been drawing more U.S. and Canadian travelers. Those who enjoy Mustique most tend to prefer an understated atmosphere and thrive on life\\'s simple pleasures. Although there\\'s a general understanding that everyone staying on the island has plenty of disposable income — especially since nightly rates at the island\\'s only hotel range from about $600 to over $1,000 — Mustique is not where they come to flaunt it. \\n In fact, it\\'s the opposite — an escape where phones are down, cameras are off, and hair and clothes are not expected to be pristine, as guests mostly drive in open-air vehicles called \"mules\" and frolic between the sea and the beach bar. From the dress code to the restaurants to the design aesthetic, everything is a bit pared down — chic without having to prove itself. It\\'s not the place for Instagram photo ops or general tourism. This environment, combined with 24/7 security to ensure safety, is perhaps the island\\'s main appeal. \\n Mustique is the destination where A-list celebrities, entrepreneurs, creatives, top executives, and even royalty come to unplug. Guests can opt for complete privacy, never needing to leave their massive villas, but after seeing the same smiling faces at the restaurant and other community spaces, people quickly become friends and end up hosting one another for dinners and private pool parties. Many return at the same time each year to see the same people and relive that same sense of community. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Time to Visit Mustique\\n\\n Like most Caribbean islands, peak season for Mustique is December through April, when visitors from Europe and the northern U.S. trade the winter blues for balmy temperatures and sunshine. One event that draws crowds is the annual Blues Festival, which typically happens at the end of January through February at Basil\\'s Bar. June through November is a quieter period since hurricane season can bring heavy — though typically fleeting — rainfall. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get to Mustique\\n\\n The most common way to get to Mustique is to fly into St. Lucia or Barbados. Once you arrive, a representative from the island will greet you and fast-track you to the Mustique lounge, where you can await your next flight. The island\\'s 18-seater Twin Otter aircraft shuttle passengers to the private island in approximately one hour. The less common, but faster, alternative is to travel directly from St. Vincent either by catamaran or a seven-minute private flight. \\n Planes are not allowed to land on Mustique after the sun goes down, so plan to arrive at your first destination no later than 3:30 p.m. so you have time to make the transfer. All arrangements can be made by contacting the island\\'s travel concierge at travel@mustique.vc. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay on Mustique\\n\\n The Cotton House is the only hotel on the island, offering a selection of luxury suites and cottages, a spa, and three dining options serving everything from local fare to international cuisine. The hotel can also arrange water activities such as snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, kayaking, and fishing. If it\\'s your first time visiting Mustique, or you\\'re traveling solo, staying here can help you settle into the unique culture of the island. Many visitors and locals congregate at the hotel for regular social events like Friday night\\'s \"happy hour-and-a-half\" and the weekly beach bonfire barbecue. \\n Island regulars and large groups often opt to stay at one of the private villas available for rent. There are more than 80 of these lavish properties, and many belong to notable names such as Tommy Hilfiger, who owns the popular Palm Beach villa. Some are designed by world-renowned architects and interior designers like Paolo Piva and David Kleinberg, whose work comes together in the Hummingbird villa. \\n All villas are staffed with housekeepers, chefs, and butlers to handle everyday needs and desires. Choose from two to nine bedrooms, an assortment of pools, modern European and traditional Caribbean design features, and views of either the Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea. From some villas, like Paradiso and Les Jolies Eaux, you can enjoy vistas taking in both bodies of water. The latter property was designed for Princess Margaret, who was a regular on the island and even has a beach named after her. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do on Mustique\\n\\n Aside from villa-hopping and endless water activities, this idyllic island offers more than you might imagine given its size. Macaroni Beach, Lagoon Beach, and Princess Margaret Beach are among the strands where guests come to sunbathe, swim, partake in water activities, and have group picnics in dedicated huts on the sand. \\n Basil\\'s Bar has been the meeting point for locals, guests, and boaters since 1976. This casual haunt overlooking Britannia Bay is perfect for lunch, dinner, and cocktails at sunset. For a livelier scene, check out weekly events like Wednesday night\\'s Jump Up featuring live music or Taco and Tequila Thursdays. \\n If you\\'re feeling sporty, the six-court Mustique Tennis Club is a social hub of the community. Visitors can enjoy complimentary tennis lessons from the resident coach, daily drop-in games, and, during peak season, regular camps and tournaments. The equestrian center offers guests the opportunity to explore the island\\'s hills on horseback, and provides lessons for children and adults at all experience levels. \\n Lastly, one of the best aspects of the island is that it\\'s so small and safe, you can explore easily on your own with a car or open-air mule vehicle, often complimentary with your accommodations. Drive to any of the destinations mentioned above, or just get lost and stumble on a remote beach, hiking trail, or something new that will make you want to return for more. \\n',\n",
              "  'Nantucket is an idyllic island paradise—except instead of tropical paradise vibes, you\\'ll find Vineyard Vine-clad gentlemen and mansions with gray, natural wood shutters. Nantucket is the epitome of summer New England life, though, unfortunately, it means much of the island shuts down in the colder months. Boasting the highest concentration of pre-Civil War homes in the country and 82 miles of pristine coastline, Nantucket is a postcard come to life. \\n From charming Nantucket hotels to five-star restaurants to the prized Nantucket beaches, this town comes alive in the warmer months. It\\'s a destination that thrives on outdoor dining (think: lobster rolls on the water), boutique shopping, and picturesque walks through town. And certainly there is no shortage of things to do in Nantucket, whether you\\'re partial to walking the beach at sunset, biking to pick up your latte in the morning, or ordering up a dozen oysters with a bottle of good Champagne. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time. (Daylight Savings Time is observed seasonally) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Summer is the high season in Nantucket, and from Memorial Day to Labor Day, you\\'ll find the best weather, with temperatures around 76° in July and August. Nonetheless, we\\'d argue that the months of May and September, before Memorial Day and after Labor Day, are the best months to go, because you\\'ll avoid the crowds that flock from Boston in the summer. \\n Nantucket Daffodil Festival (April), Nantucket Wine Festival (May), and Nantucket Book Festival (June) all draw sizable crowds and are wonderful times to visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n The entire island of Nantucket is only 14 miles long by 3.5 miles wide. It\\'s 30 miles from Cape Cod and accessible by ferry and plane. \\n The most popular neighborhoods to spend time in for tourists are Nantucket\\'s centrally located Historic Downtown and Siasconset (which most refer to as \"Sconset\") on the east side of the island. \\n Nantucket Historical Association manages the Whaling Museum and eight additional historic sites around the island, including Hadwen House and Greater Light. The organization, focused on preserving Nantucket\\'s historic beauty, was founded in 1854 and sees approximately 95,000 visitors each year. \\n Exploring the island by bike is very popular—there are three primary bike trails on the island, each well-maintained: one in Madaket, one in Surfside, and one in Sconset. \\n Nantucket is known for its seafood, especially their fried clams (whole-belly fried clams are a classic New England treat), oysters, and lobster. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Buses: The WAVE, an entity of Nantucket Regional Transit Authority, is the bus system on the island. There are a myriad of bus routes and stations throughout the island, and all buses are wheelchair accessible and outfitted with bike racks. There are $2 bus loops (Mid-Island Loop, Miacomet Loop, and Jetties Beach) and $3 loops (Madaket Route, Sconset Routes, Airport Route, and Surfside Beach). You can pay with cash using the fare box. Travelers over the age of 65 ride for half price, and children under six ride for free. \\n Taxis: You can easily find a taxi at Nantucket Memorial Airport, Straight Wharf, and Steamboat Wharf. There is also a taxi stand at Lower Main Street/South Water Street and another at Main Street/Washington Street. Find a full list of cab companies (with contact information) here. \\n Car service: You can easily find rideshare services like Uber and Lyft on Nantucket. \\n Ferry: The ferry to Nantucket leaves from Hyannis on Cape Cod. The Steamship Authority runs a two-and-a-half-hour ferry to Nantucket (which can accommodate cars), and an express one-hour ferry (which does not allow cars). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: White Elephant Nantucket\\n\\n Address: 50 Easton Street, Nantucket, MA 02554Phone: (800) 445-6574Book Now \\n Quintessential coastal New England mansions with wooden shutters, salty air coming off the water, and beachfront lobster rolls are the essence of White Elephant Nantucket.

Though it\\'s not situated on the beach, the 62-room property reminds guests that they are, indeed, on an island, from the coastal accoutrements in rooms (rope fixtures, shell details, a soothing color palette) to the Mediterranean-inspired, seafood-centric menu offerings at the on-site restaurant, Sister Ship. The indoor-outdoor eatery serves lunch and dinner (and cocktails and wines). Sidle up to one of the bar stools or comfy sofas inside the eclectic lounge or grab a seat on the breezy patio. Arguably the main attraction, however, is the photogenic, secret garden-like courtyard, outfitted in rattan chairs and fringed umbrellas, all surrounded by the property\\'s clapboard buildings. It\\'s not uncommon to see passersby stopping in for a peek (and an Instagram snap), inevitably lured in to grab a cocktail. Bikes are also available on loan for guests wanting to explore the area, and in-room maps help craft the perfect itinerary, though the front desk will happily share recommendations. The whole experience is inspired by 1920s Paris and the fantastical adventures of a female ship captain. \"It\\'s a bit of revelry tucked into a historic and refined collection of buildings,\" Jason Brown of Blue Flag Partners, the hotel\\'s creators, shared in a statement. \"It\\'s like what we imagined might have happened back in the \\'20s in Gertrude Stein\\'s living room in Paris, but on an island.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Straight Wharf Restaurant\\n\\n Address: 12 Cambridge Street, Nantucket, MA 02554Phone: (508) 228-4499Website \\n Some of the most luxurious dining on Nantucket can be found at Straight Wharf Restaurant.

              "  'Adrian Rudd/Travel + Leisure \\n Napa is best known as a booming wine region, serving up some of the top vintages outside of France (and arguably, some of the best wines in the world). The rolling hills and sunny skies make the region a picturesque spot for a quick getaway. And while wine is the main draw, there\\'s plenty to the region worth exploring—all just a two-hour drive north of San Francisco. \\n Throughout the valley there are a number of towns filled with quaint shops, Michelin-starred restaurants, luxurious hotels, and unique spa experiences. And with over 400 wineries in the region, Napa Valley is definitely a destination worth revisiting again and again. So whether you\\'re looking for a romantic retreat, a getaway with friends, or a trip for the family, there\\'s something for everyone to enjoy. \\n Here, we\\'ve put together the best of what Napa Valley has to offer. Cheers! \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Daylight Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The tourist season in Napa corresponds with the annual grape harvest from August to October, but that also means that prices are at their highest and travelers should expect wait times and the need for reservations when out exploring. Late spring is a great alternative because the weather is just as nice and crowds are more manageable. And in late May, the area hosts the annual three-day-long BottleRock festival with dozens of acts from some of the world\\'s top musicians, drawing in crowds of over 100,000. \\n In the summer, temperatures can get a bit hot during the day, but there are plenty of wineries to explore where you can dip into air conditioned tasting rooms or take a seat on a covered patio. The area also hosts its annual Napa Wine Fest each July, and showcases some of the region\\'s top vintners and wineries, plus others from surrounding wine regions like Sonoma and Lake Mendocino. \\n The area really gets into the holiday spirit during the late fall and early winter months, and it just so happens to coincide with cabernet season (which runs from November through April). Crowds are at their lowest, but so are rates. And while the temperatures are a bit frosty, that\\'s nothing that a glass of wine or two can\\'t fix. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Due to the region\\'s geographic spread, it\\'s best advised to explore the region by car (just make sure to have a designated driver while visiting wineries). While there\\'s public transportation available, it\\'s easiest to go at your own pace instead of navigating bus routes or paying out for a taxi. \\n And while temperatures can peak in the 90s during the summer months, the nights can get surprisingly cold, dropping as much as 40 degrees in a single day. So it\\'s best to pack a variety of outfits to make sure you\\'re comfortable at all times. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Amtrak San Joaquins takes travelers from the Bay Area straight to the heart of downtown Napa. The ride takes anywhere from two to three hours, depending on whether you\\'re leaving from Emeryville or Salesforce Plaza. \\n Buses: Napa Valley\\'s public bus system is called The Vine and runs from El Cerrito Del Norte all the way up to Calistoga. \\n Taxis: There are a handful of taxi services in Napa that can easily be arranged for quick pickup and drop offs wherever you need to be. Vern\\'s Taxi Service and Yellow Cab Napa are the highest rated, but both Uber and Lyft also operate in the area. Car service: Napa Valley has plenty of private car and limousine options, perfect for those who don\\'t want to worry about getting around if they\\'re out wine tasting. Napa Valley Limousine Services and Napa Sonoma Wine Tasting Driver are the two highest rated. For those looking for a ride to various attractions and tastings with a guide who can help plan their itinerary and share some Napa history along the way, consider booking with Bohemian Highway. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: 180 Rutherford Hill Rd, Rutherford, CA 94573Phone: (707) 963-1211Website \\n For those looking for expansive views paired with a luxurious stay, Auberge du Soleil is just what you\\'re after.

              "  'Visiting India is a bucket-list trip for plenty of seasoned travelers, and you can\\'t do better than starting your Indian vacation in New Delhi. From the essential attractions—like the Red Fort and Baháʼí Lotus Temple—to the incomparable North Indian cuisine on display at both high-end restaurants and street stalls in Old Delhi, the capital of India will set the tone for your travels. And not only can you easily drive or train to nearby, must-visit destinations like Agra and Jaipur, but you can take short-haul flights from Delhi to southern staples like Goa or Kerala. \\n To guide your travels though New Delhi, we\\'ve outlined the best hotels in the city (and just wait until you experience Indian hospitality to the fullest extent at these five-star properties). We\\'ve also covered where to shop in Delhi, must-try restaurants, and notable points of interest. Follow this guide to neighborhoods like Lodhi Colony (the first public arts district in India), bazaars brimming with stalls selling antiques and embroidered silk, and restaurants serving hot-off-the-grill seekh kebabs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n India Standard Time (Greenwich Mean Time +5:30) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n It\\'s best to avoid May through September in India, when the heat is sweltering. The downpours are also fairly intense in July, August, and September, during what\\'s known as monsoon season. From a weather perspective, November to March are the best time to visit New Delhi, when it\\'s coolest and driest—with temperatures in the 70s and 80s. \\n As for special events, Diwali happens in December, which lights up the city. In March, the city celebrates spring with vibrantly colored Holi celebrations, which is exciting to experience as a visitor. If visiting for the festival of light (Diwali) or color (Holi) isn\\'t possible, New Delhi also celebrates Republic Day on January 26 with an impressive parade. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Hindi is the national language in India. \"Namaste\" is the word for \"hello.\" When greeting people, say namaste while bringing your hands together at your heart and bowing just slightly. It\\'s also common to say \"namaskaar\" as a greeting. \\n It is not safe to drink tap water in India. Only drink bottled water—many tourists even choose to brush their teeth with bottled water. When you\\'re sold a bottle of water, check the seal to make sure it\\'s a brand-new bottle, rather than one that\\'s been refilled. \\n Some of the most important holidays in India are Diwali (October or November), Holi (March), and Navrati (September or October). Dates vary for each of the holidays. \\n You need to apply for a visa to visit India. It can be easily obtained from the Indian government. \\n Calling Code: +91 \\n Currency: Indian Rupee (Check the current exchange rate) \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The Delhi Metro has improved significantly in recent years. The rapid transport cars bring locals and tourists seamlessly around the city, and the Airport Metro Express Line provides transportation from Delhi Airport. You can buy a tourist metro day pass for 150 rupees or a three-day pass for 300 rupees. \\n Buses: The metropolis is serviced by DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses. The buses are not always air conditioned and get fairly crowded. Fares run from 5 to 25 rupees depending on the length of your trip. \\n Taxis and Rickshaws: For short trips around Delhi, it\\'s easy to hop in a rickshaw on the street, which features a carriage and is pulled by a cyclist. For longer trips, you can also take an auto-rickshaw, which is essentially an open-air carriage with a typical car engine. Auto-rickshaws double as taxi cabs, though you can also call an on-demand taxi. Car service: Ola Cabs are very popular in Delhi, and the city is also serviced by Uber. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The Oberoi, New Delhi\\n\\n Address: Dr Zakir Hussain Marg, Delhi Golf Club, Golf Links,New Delhi, Delhi 110003, IndiaPhone: +91 11 2436 3030Website \\n The Oberoi properties are known for their opulence, and when you combine that with Indian warmth and hospitality, the resulting experience is exceptional.

Take yourself on a museum crawl, starting at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on the northeastern edge of Central Park. Then, make your way north several blocks to the Guggenheim Museum and eventually to the Museum of the City of New York, one of the best places to learn about the Big Apple\\'s history. \\n Go to Chinatown for dim sum and to Little Italy for cannoli. Head to a jazz club in Harlem, check out the independent artist galleries that dot Chelsea, shop along Fifth Avenue, and pay a visit to the Statue of Liberty. \\n You could spend an entire day in Central Park alone, checking out its zoo, carousel, lakes, and ice rink. A number of gardens and meadows make for excellent people-watching and host impromptu musical performances on nice days. Traveling in the summer? Make sure to check the schedule for Shakespeare in the Park. \\n Prefer sports, movies, and live music? See the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, the New York Mets at Citi Field, or the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Track down sites from your favorite movies and TV shows. Seinfeld, Sex and the City, \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" \"Serendipity,\" and \"Home Alone 2\" are just a small fraction of what\\'s been filmed here. \\n New York is a city filled with attractions, but some of its most interesting experiences are sure to be the ones you accidentally stumble upon on the way to somewhere else. Whatever it is you\\'re looking for, you can find it in New York. Just don\\'t try to do everything in one trip. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n New York is a city that\\'s always celebrating something, and summer is one of the best times to visit. Outdoor concert season is in full swing. Free movies and theatrical performances fill the city\\'s parks, street vendors are everywhere, and street fairs abound. But subway platforms can get steamy, lines can get long, and temperatures can soar among the city\\'s high-rises. If this sounds like misery, visit between Thanksgiving and the New Year, when temperatures are cooler and department store windows are decked out for the holidays. During this time, Manhattan\\'s three major outdoor ice rinks are open, a giant Christmas tree marks Rockefeller Center, and holiday light shows are more elaborate than anything you could ever imagine. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n New York is a city made up of five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Most tourist attractions are in Manhattan, with a few scattered across Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. \\n Driving in Manhattan is unnecessary. The city has an extensive public transit system, making it easy to get just about anywhere by subway, bus, cab, and foot. Uber and Lyft are plentiful, while parking can be both a miserable and expensive experience. Meanwhile, the subway is open 24/7. \\n New York is a city that moves fast. Step aside to look at your phone, and remember to stand on the right side of the escalator so hurried commuters can walk on the left. \\n Times Square characters can be pushy. Tipping is at your discretion. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The New York City subway is one of the most extensive public transit systems in the world. It connects Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and runs on Staten Island. Each ride costs $2.75. A seven-day pass is available for $33 and covers both trains and buses. \\n Buses: A network of buses offers easy access to the rare spots not served by nearby train stations and to New York\\'s LaGuardia Airport. Individual bus rides cost $2.75. Seven-day transit passes cost $33 and cover trains and buses. While buses can be convenient, traffic can sometimes make them easy to outwalk. \\n Ferries: One of the best ways to hop among New York\\'s boroughs in good weather is a ferry. Ferries connect Queens, the western coast of Brooklyn, the eastern side of Manhattan, and Staten Island. Rides are $2.75 each. Subway and bus passes aren\\'t accepted on New York ferries. The Staten Island Ferry is free. \\n Taxis: Cabs are all over Manhattan, but a little harder to find in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Green cabs offer service in northern Manhattan and the outer boroughs. To hail a cab, look for one that has its light on and raise your arm. All New York cabs are metered and required to accept credit cards. \\n Rideshare: Uber and Lyft are all over New York and offer similar pricing. Rideshare can be the best way to travel in parts of Brooklyn and Queens. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The Plaza\\n\\n Address: 768 5th Ave., New York, NY 10019 \\n Phone: (212) 759-3000 \\n Book Now \\n If money is no object and you\\'ve always dreamed of sleeping in a castle, this is the hotel for you.

              "  'Nicaragua is a postcard-worthy destination that harkens back to simpler travel times. \\n Lined with emerald-green coasts dotted with old-school fishing villages, it\\'s a place where you can surf nearly empty lineups as if you were still in the \\'70s. \\n I\\'ve sailed around its Pacific coast in a catamaran, stopping at deserted islands to watch dolphins frolic by. I\\'ve danced salsa in a corner bar in Granada, one of the oldest colonial cities in Latin America. I\\'ve ridden motorcycles through dense jungle trails in Popoyo, had gallo pinto on the side of the Pan-American Highway, and made friends that will last a lifetime. But these experiences barely scratch the surface of why Nicaragua is one of my favorite destinations. \\n For starters, Nicaragua is not for everyone. It\\'s rugged and traditional, with a bit of edge and a bloody past. But it\\'s also home to a rich cultural heritage and friendly locals who go out of their way to get you the most delicious seafood, help you catch a wave, or show you the way around the backroads. \\n I first went to Nicaragua in 2015, when the country was experiencing somewhat of a golden age. A combination of affordability, an under-the-radar reputation, and the rise of surf tourism made towns such as San Juan del Sur popular. This lasted for about three short years. It was a time when things were fairly peaceful, the economy was growing, and tourism was booming. Since then, due to civil unrest and the pandemic, it has become less common to see positive headlines about the nation, but what keeps people coming back to Nicaragua — stunning nature, pristine beaches, and lively culture — is still intact. \\n Nicaragua is set between the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Upon landing in the capital city of Managua, most people flock to the Pacific, where the surf is some of the most consistent in all of Central America and the cities of Leon and Granada offer deep cultural insight into this beach destination. Yet, it\\'s on the Caribbean coast where you\\'ll find the most untouched lands. In this area, expect to find Indigenous, Creole, and British influences in the fishing communities that live among the mangrove-filled jungle. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go to Nicaragua\\n\\n While many tropical countries around the world count on an extremely dry and rainy season, Nicaragua has a milder version of both. The dry season here runs from November through May, though it\\'s not as barren as its neighbor Costa Rica. Meanwhile, the rainy season, which spans April through October, brings torrential downpours (especially in October), but note that it\\'s rare for it to rain all day every day. \\n The one thing that\\'s rather consistent in Nicaragua is the temperature. According to Weather Spark, \"The temperature in Managua varies so little throughout the year that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss hot and cold seasons.\" \\n One more forecast you may be interested in is the surf. According to Giant\\'s Foot Surf, for waist- to head-high swells, visit Nicaragua between March and September. But if you\\'re looking for larger waves, you may need to come in the middle of the rainy season — between May to August — which Giant\\'s Foot Surf calls the nation\\'s \"prime time.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do in Nicaragua\\n\\n No trip to Nicaragua is complete without a deep dive into the world of surf, sun, and sandboarding. \\n The Pacific coast of Nicaragua is lined with beaches for all surf levels. Some must-see spots include Playa Maderas, Popoyo, El Tránsito, Playa Colorado, and Playa Hermosa, and it\\'s possible to experience all of these during a weeklong trip. \\n El Tránsito is a short, 90-minute drive from the Managua airport. In El Tránsito, you\\'ll find yourself immersed in a tight-knit community of locals and about some expat families. Stay at Mandla, a boutique hotel designed by a couple from England and South Africa. Make sure to eat every item on their menu, especially the fresh oysters. \\n Further south, you can stop at Popoyo, where consistent offshore winds and epic waves make it one of the best places to surf in all of Central America. Malibu Popoyo, a 12-room resort tailor-made for surfing families, is perfectly perched across from the beach, and stays here come with a great surf coach and tour guide. \\n Next, head down to Playa Maderas for a more mellow, family-friendly beach experience ideal for beginners. If surfing is not your thing, don\\'t worry, as these beaches also flourish with local life, seafood restaurants, and occasional live music. \\n Want to see more land, but don\\'t want to forgo surfing? Volcano boarding is your best bet. Yes, we are talking about sliding down Cerro Negro after hiking to the summit at 2,300 feet. The trek is challenging, but the ride back is unforgettable. All you have to do is hold a string attached to a wooden plank and slide down to the bottom at an average speed of 50 mph. \\n Lastly, visit Ometepe, an island formed by two volcanoes rising out of Lake Nicaragua. To arrive, hop aboard one of the wooden transport boats that may also be carrying anything from chickens to motorcycles. On Ometepe, you can choose to trek up the volcanic peaks, swim in natural pools, get lost on nature trails, or taste coffee right next to the field in which the beans are grown. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels in Nicaragua\\n\\n Anyone who lands in Managua also has the option to drive north or south, to choose between more populated areas or seclusion. But regardless of the direction, Nicaragua is full of small boutique hotels from renowned designers and hoteliers who flocked to the country in search of a more laid-back lifestyle. \\n For a design-forward property, check into the Tribal Hotel in Granada. Aside from its location on a colorful street, the New Yorkers who own the hotel traveled the world seeking unique pieces that complement the artisanship of local craftsmen. From Copacabana pool tiles to Indonesian batik fabrics, Tribal feels like a slice of the world on an unassuming corner in the bustling colonial city. \\n For those wanting to surf exclusive Playa Colorado, located within a gated community near Popoyo, Aurea is your best bet for guaranteed access to the world-class waves. The brutalist-inspired guest house, which was dreamed up by a group of Venezuelans, feels less like a hotel and more like a home within a community of expats and well-to-do Nicaraguans. \\n For something more accessible, book a stay at the aforementioned Malibu Popoyo, a 12-room boutique hotel owned by a female surfer and entrepreneur who fell in love with the area during a surf trip. Perfect for families in search of adventure and comfort, as well as surfers and creative types, the property is located a few steps from the beach and boasts an on-site organic restaurant. \\n',\n",
              "  'Oahu is the third largest of the Hawaiian islands, located southeast of Kauai. The most populous of the islands, Oahu is home to the stabookte capital of Honolulu and its cosmopolitan surroundings. Historic sites like Iolani Palace and Bishop Museum contrast with modern luxury hotels and highrise apartments. The glittering skyline, along with the Diamond Head crater, form a stunning backdrop for Waikiki\\'s popular beaches. \\n Not far from the shops, restaurants, and hotels of Honolulu and Waikiki Beach, the scenery changes to quiet beaches, green valleys, and mountain views. On the windward or east coast of the island, beaches like Kailua, Makapu\\'u, and Lanikai offer white sand, shade trees, and waves for surfing, snorkeling, and bodyboarding. On the North Shore, visitors find more than seven miles of the famous beaches that attract surfers from around the world, especially during the winter months when the waves are big and challenging. The Leeward, or west coast, is sunny and dry with luxury resorts and its own surfing beach, Makaha. \\n Oahu\\'s central valley has been home to plantations since the late 19th century, and pineapples are still grown there. To the south, historic Pearl Harbor is an active naval base and the location of historic monuments commemorating its place in World War II history. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Hawaii follows Hawaii Standard Time (GMT-10 hours), which is five hours behind Eastern Standard Time and two hours behind Pacific Standard Time. Hawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time, so add one extra hour to the time difference during this period (March through November). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n It\\'s nearly always a good time to go to Oahu. The summer season, mainly April through October, sees higher temperatures and less precipitation. June, July, and August are popular with vacationers when schools are generally out, and the weather is warm and dry. Mid-December through March is a peak time, especially for visitors from colder climates. \\n Winter, from December through March, is slightly cooler, but still warm and sunny although there\\'s a bit more rain. The climate varies across different areas of the island. The weather is drier on the west side, and the east coast receives more rain. The southern areas of Honolulu and Waikiki are pleasant year-round. \\n Laura La Monaca/Travel + Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Oahu is the second oldest of the Hawaiian Islands. \\n Oahu\\'s two mountain ranges, the Waianae on the west and the Koolau on the east, were once volcanoes. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the volcanoes last erupted more than 70,000 years ago. \\n Oahu\\'s volcanoes are extinct, and the most famous of the remaining cones are Diamond Head (Leahi), Punchbowl, and Koko Head craters. \\n The nickname of Oahu is \"The Gathering Place,\" probably based on its central location and its history as a place where people went for marriages, births, and funerals. \\n The majority of Hawaii\\'s population of 1,411,150 live on the island of Oahu, with a population of 953,207. \\n Waikiki, home of famous beaches and hotels, is located in Honolulu. The area was created with the construction of the Ala Wai Canal in 1928, changing the swamplands into one of the best-known beaches in the world. \\n The only royal palace in the United States is located on Oahu. It is Iolani Palace in downtown Honolulu. \\n Hawaii is the only state with two official languages: English and \\'Ōlelo Hawai\\'i, an endangered language, now part of a revival effort. \\n It is customary to remove one\\'s shoes when entering someone\\'s home. \\n The \"shaka\" or \"hang loose\" gesture (waving the extended thumb and little finger with the three middle fingers curved) is said to have originated among surfers on Oahu\\'s North Shore. Its meanings include \"hello,\" \"goodbye,\" \"chill out,\" \"thank you,\" and the popular greeting, \"Howzit?\" \\n The most popular tourist attraction on Oahu is the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n The Bus - On Oahu, The Bus offers frequent bus schedules and numerous routes providing wide island coverage.

From famous Waikiki to the North Shore\\'s waves to calm lagoons, you\\'ll find the perfect beach whether you want to surf, swim, snorkel, or just sunbathe on the sand. \\n Away from the beach, a favorite activity on Oahu is hiking. Every part of the island offers opportunities for hikers of various skill levels. Minutes from Waikiki, Leahi (Diamond Head) is a moderately challenging trail that includes two sets of stairs rewarding hikers with panoramic views at the top. \\n Take a drive around the island, either heading east out of Honolulu towards Makapu\\'u Point and then north along the Windward Coast between the ocean and the mountains. Stop at lookout points for photos or just to enjoy the view. Or head west and then north along the Leeward Coast for a look at the waves of Makaha. \\n Be sure to try island specialties like shave ice (not shaved!) finely shaved and topped with flavored syrup and malasadas — fried donut-like dough covered in sugar. Don\\'t miss a local favorite, Spam musubi which is similar to sushi with rice and seaweed wrap, but meat instead of fish. Loco moco is another favorite, with variations based on white rice topped with a hamburger, fried egg, and gravy.

              "  'Stephanie Pollak/Travel + Leisure \\n Boasting an endless supply of mezcal and mole, Oaxaca de Juárez is undoubtedly one of the ultimate food and drink destinations on the planet. So, it\\'s perhaps no surprise that in Travel + Leisure\\'s 2023 World\\'s Best Awards, it was named the best city in the world. (The city is commonly referred to as Oaxaca, but shouldn\\'t be confused with the eponymous state it\\'s a part of.) \\n This dynamic city in southwestern Mexico is home to vibrant culture, beautiful weather, and some of the country\\'s most iconic architecture. \"The most remarkable thing about Oaxaca is the deep presence of this pre-Colombian culture in all aspects of contemporary life — the mingling and mixing of Indigenous, Spanish, and contemporary Mexican influences are unique and unforgettable,\" said Zachary Rabinor, a member of T+L\\'s A-List of travel advisors and the CEO of Journey Mexico. \\n You could spend several weeks here and not even scratch the surface — if you weren\\'t planning correctly, that is. \"Oaxaca is a quintessential and magical destination that combines culture, nature, and adventure, with a year-round spring-like climate due to its idyllic location nestled into a fertile valley of the Sierra Madre Sur Mountains,\" Rabinor said.\\xa0\"It offers a charming, pedestrian-friendly UNESCO World Heritage Site City Center with impressive architecture, museums, markets, restaurants, shopping, and nightlife, while the surrounding valleys harbor incredible Indigenous villages that conserve century-old artisan traditions, dress, language, culture, and lifestyles.\" \\n To that end, we\\'ve compiled a list of the best things to do, see, and sip while exploring this exciting part of the world. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Hotels and Resorts\\n\\n Oaxaca features all manner of lodging, ranging from unassuming bed-and-breakfasts to historic converted convents, all the way up to the most opulent and palatial of modern luxury. You\\'ll find a little bit of each in this city. \\n If you\\'re not afraid to spend a few hundred per night, you can enjoy the modern boutique beauty of Hotel Casa Santo Origen. Just 15 minutes from the city center, each of the eight suites in this small hotel is named after a unique region of the state of Oaxaca, and decorated with local art. \\n Book Now: Hotels.com | Expedia | Trip Advisor \\n If you want something more old-fashioned, check in at Quinta Real Oaxaca — a 16th-century nunnery retaining a thorough throwback charm without sacrificing modern amenities. The property boasts views of courtyards and the streets of Oaxaca and even has an idyllic garden pool. \\n Book Now: Hotels.com | Expedia | Trip Advisor \\n If you\\'d prefer to stay in the heart of mezcal country, you\\'ll want to book your stay at the stunning Casa Silencio, which is about an hour outside of Oaxaca. This upscale shrine to agave features multilevel guest rooms, a spa, and Michelin-caliber cuisine and mixology. And, oh yes, a working distillery pumping out the native liquid. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Within Oaxaca, Rabinor said taking a day to leisurely explore the city center and downtown is the way to go. \"Take your time strolling through the market and be sure to try\\xa0pan de yema con chocolate,\" Rabinor said. \"Find a spot in one of the many plazas and enjoy people-watching, as it\\'s not uncommon to witness a colorful calenda (street procession) happening at any time of the week. These processions are part of the numerous festivals that celebrate various personal and communal events in the lives of the local community.\" \\n When it\\'s time for sightseeing beyond the city, one of the top natural wonders to explore is Hierve el Agua. These calcareous rock formations in San Lorenzo Albarradas look as if a waterfall has been frozen to the side of a cliff. Established hiking paths bring you right up to the cascade\\'s edge. If you\\'re looking to take a dip in the human-made pools, aim to get there early to avoid crowds. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n Perched atop a 1,300-foot tall plateau, Monte Albán is a UNESCO World Heritage Site containing a well-preserved terraced pyramid and other pre-Columbian cultural artifacts. Much of what you\\'ll explore here was built by the Zapotecs, an Indigenous people who are thought to have settled in the region as early as 800 B.C.E. It is the second-largest ceremonial site in all of Central America. \"Monte Albán is not only a treasure of ancient history, but also a UNESCO World Heritage Site that holds significant importance in understanding the cultural heritage of Oaxaca and the surrounding region,\" Rabinor told T+L. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n Mezcal is a distilled agave spirit traditional to the Oaxacan region. It has been made here for centuries using techniques that have largely resisted the prying hands of modern machination. Whether you drink or don\\'t, a mezcal experience is an enriching experience. Rabinor noted that it supports local communities that rely on the industry, helps people \"understand the hard work and history that goes behind producing [mezcal], and lets travelers \\'learn and appreciate one of the world’s most complex spirits.\\'\"Running down the many palenques — farm distilleries — where it is made and the enchanting sipping parlors where it is served would require an entirely separate article. (In fact, this is a good one right here.) But assuming you\\'re starting your liquid journey in the city of Oaxaca, these are four tasting opportunities you should not skip over: Mezcalería In Situ for a broad collection of bottles and emphasis on education; El Distilado to enjoy how mezcal pairs with the local cuisine; and Selva Oaxaca to see how it mixes into artisanal cocktails. For a sip with a view, take your thirst to the rooftop of Puro Burro, a hip watering hole founded by native agave impresario, Asis Cortes — the man behind Mezcal Dixeebe. \\n Susmita Baral/Travel + Leisure \\n The state of Oaxaca is home to over 300 miles of coastline, so there are plenty of beaches to explore on a weekend getaway. Puerto Escondido, for example, is amassing a lot of tourist attention from beachgoers these days. (A flight from OAX to Puerto Escondido — PXM — is about 45 minutes.) \\n There\\'s also Mazunte, with its cerulean surf crashing into the jagged shore. (Check out the Mexican Turtle Center in town, dedicated to the preservation of everyone\\'s favorite slow-moving reptile.) And if you want to speed things up a bit, head several miles east along the coast to Zipolite. There are powerful waves pummeling this sand, popular with surfers. Though others opt to simply lay and tan, enjoying the sunset over surrounding cliffs. Or you can snorkel the protected coral reefs of neighboring Huatulco National Park. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Oaxaca is filled with small boutiques with handmade goods for every budget. Mercado 20 de Noviembre is a market with goods like sandals, bags, homeware, and more. \\n Rabinor recommended not skipping the artisan communities outside of town, such as San Martín Tilcajete, San Bartolo Coyotepec, and Teotitlan del Valle. \"[This is] where skilled communities create exquisite works of art, including colorful alebrijes (wooden figurines), intricate black pottery, and vibrant textiles,\" he said. \\n For food, consider stopping by Mercado de Abastos. You can book a tour of the market through the area\\'s most popular guide: Omar Alonso. \"This is where locals go to buy everything,\" Alonso told T+L. \"During holidays, it\\'s particularly packed as we gather the ingredients we\\'ll need to offer to our guests that come during the festivities.\" And for mezcal, visit Mezcaleria Cuish for both a drink and some bottles to-go. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n You\\'ll want to savor the world-class cuisine offered throughout Oaxaca and you\\'ll have no trouble finding it when you\\'re strolling the streets. \\n The hub\\'s bustling market scene is a great place to absorb a bit of everything. Mercado 20 de Noviembre is famous for its variety of food stalls featuring everything from baked goods and pastries to an entire aisle of roasted proteins: \"El Pasillo de las Carnes Asadas.\" Here, you can order trays of meat that get cooked fresh in front of you.

The temperature can vary wildly depending on where you\\'re visiting and when. \"The best time to visit Oaxaca depends on your preferences for weather, cultural events, and crowd levels,\" Rabinor said. \\n The good news is that it\\'s almost always pleasantly warm and abundantly sunny. The one exception is the rainy season, which extends from May into September. Rabinor said that while the rainy season \"brings occasional showers and higher humidity\" it also \"offers lush landscapes and fewer visitors. \\n July is a popular month, according to Rabinor, that can be crowded since it overlaps with the cultural festival of Guelaguetza, also called the Lunes del Cerro or \"Mondays on the Hill.\" \\n Gabriel Perez/Getty Images \\n Early November is also a perennially popular time to visit. The weather is dependably inviting, as it\\'s the start of the dry season, which extends through April. You\\'ll also experience Día de los Muertos celebrations, bringing mirth, marigold, and mesmerizing pageantry into the streets of cities and villages throughout the country. Even if you miss these particular festivities, arrive sometime between fall and spring break, and you\\'ll leave with little to no regrets. \\n Read More: The Best Time to Visit Mexico for Good Weather and Affordable Prices \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Oaxaca is most easily reached through Xoxocotlán International Airport (OAX) — a smaller-sized airport. Direct service from the United States arrives by way of Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston. One way to snag a bargain fare is to fly into Guadalajara (GDL) or Mexico City (MEX), and then take a domestic carrier to OAX. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Oaxaca is a walkable city so you don\\'t need to rent a car. While a vehicle is helpful when visiting sites outside of the city, like Hierve el Agua, you can opt for a local car service to drive you to farther destinations. Should you want transportation from point A to point B within the downtown, cabs are readily available. To get to and from the airport, you can take a taxi, bus, or rental car. \\n',\n",

              "  'Palm Springs, California is located about 100 miles east of Los Angeles in the Coachella Valley area of the Sonoran Desert. A popular resort city for many years, Palm Springs is known for its natural hot springs, hotels, restaurants, golf courses, and sunny weather. It\\'s been a favorite destination for Hollywood stars since the 1930s, and many celebrities maintain homes in the Palm Springs area. \\n The climate is one of the most attractive features of Palm Springs, and desert communities have spread eastward as the demand for homes has increased. Until relatively recently, many Palm Springs hotels, restaurants, and attractions closed during the hot summer months. Now, however, Palm Springs and the nearby communities are home to year-round residents as well as snowbirds and second home owners. \\n Palm Springs is a welcoming community with one of the largest numbers of same-sex households in the country. A number of resorts cater to LGBTQ+ tourists, and the city hosts the annual White Party in April and the Greater Palm Springs Pride Celebration every November with a parade and a number of events. \\n Downtown Palm Springs is always evolving, with new shops, restaurants, hotels, and neighborhoods, like the development of the north end as the Uptown Design District. The annual Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals have brought attention to the desert cities, and the January Palm Springs International Film Festival attracts top names and a growing number of visitors. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time.

Summer temperatures are typically around 100℉ and can reach as high as 115℉, with humidity less than 10%. Many visitors enjoy the hot, dry summer weather, especially if there\\'s a pool nearby. \\n High season is from December through April, when snowbirds arrive from Canada and cold parts of the U.S. Hotel prices are generally higher, and restaurants, golf courses, and attractions are more crowded. December, January, and February are considered the rainy months, but precipitation is normally around just an inch or so, although there have been years with heavier rains. \\n Festivals like the Palm Springs International Film Festival in early January, Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals in April, Pride events in November, the PGA Tour\\'s American Express Men\\'s Golf Tournament in January, and the LPGA ANA Inspiration Tournament in April bring in more visitors during those times.

The annual February Modernism Week celebrates mid-century modern design, architecture, art, fashion, and culture, with a fall preview in October. \\n The Greater Palm Springs area is home to nearly 125 public, municipal, and private golf courses. \\n More than 2,000 years ago, Palm Springs\\' first residents were the ancestors of today\\'s Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.

              "  'Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n Paris is a city unlike any other. It is overflowing with culture, history, and beauty. And while people travel to Paris to see the Louvre, climb the Eiffel Tower, or see Notre-Dame, the real magic is found in the streets. Here, the ins and outs of daily life play out — chic women on bikes pedal their children to school, artists post up in cafés with a notebook, and both young and old line up morning and evening for a fresh baguette from the neighborhood boulangerie. It is likely everything you imagined, and then a bit more — because while Paris is a city with a strong cultural identity, it also houses people from all over the world who add their own culture and customs into the mix. This is why a visit to Paris\\' top sights is simply not enough — to truly get a sense of the city, take to the streets where the essence and enchantment of Paris is most felt. \\n As you explore the streets of Paris, you\\'ll find yourself walking the hills of Montmartre in search of that perfect crepe spot or meandering through Belleville, a Chinese neighborhood interspersed with hip, young Parisians and elaborate murals. Across the Seine, you might find yourself enjoying an all-too-early verre du vin at a café in Saint-Germain-des-Prés or exploring the winding streets of the Latin Quarter. It doesn\\'t take much to find yourself fully immersed in this special city. \\n To make sure you don\\'t miss a thing, take a moment to read through our Paris travel guide, where we share our favorite local haunts, must-do activities, and favorite hotels. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time (GMT+1) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n It\\'s hard to beat a visit to Paris in the spring or summer when the weather is warm, Parisians flock to the parks, and all seems right in the world. If you want to avoid the crowds, a trip in the month of August — when most Parisians go on vacation — is hard to beat, although be prepared for some restaurant and shop closures. And somehow even during the winter, when the skies tend to be grey and the temperatures low, Paris still shines — all you need is an extra layer or two. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: FrenchI don\\'t speak French: Je ne parle pas français.I\\'m lost: Je suis perdu(e).I would like… : Je voudrais...Learn more French phrases \\n Calling Code: +33 \\n Capital City: Paris \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The easiest (and often, the fastest) way to get around the city is by train. There are Paris metro and RER train stops throughout the city, with a one-way journey costing around $2. Single and multi-day passes start at $14. \\n Buses: The bus network offers a great, above-ground alternative to the Paris train system. A single journey costs around $2 and is often used to connect metro stations that are spaced further apart. \\n Taxis: There are several taxi companies in Paris — G7 is a great option that accepts credit cards and has its own app. Uber also operates in Paris. \\n Car service: If you feel more comfortable arranging your airport pick-up in advance, take advantage of services offered by car service companies like Paris Black Cars or Blacklane. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Hôtel de Crillon\\n\\n Address: 10 Place de la Concorde, 75008 Paris, FrancePhone: +33 1 44 71 15 00Book Now \\n Hôtel de Crillon seems to have it all — a location at Place de la Concorde, easy access to the Champs-Élysées, and stunning views of the Eiffel Tower.

This delicious, but affordable spot in the Marais was conceptualized by Brittany-born Bertrand Larcher — and their amazing galettes and crepes can now be found as far as Japan.

Brady spoke with Patrick Branco Ruivo, the managing director of the iconic attraction. \"His advice for beating the lines? First, try to book tickets in advance; they go on sale 60 days out. Second, consider a splurge to make your visit stress-free. A newly launched \\'Grand Tour\\' will whisk you and up to five other guests past every line, with a private guide, right to the top. The experience also includes, naturally, a Champagne toast, plus a behind-the-scenes look at the tower’s hydraulic lift system. Grand tour from $2,334 for up to six people.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: Musée d\\'Orsay\\n\\n Address: 1 Rue de la Légion d\\'Honneur, 75007 Paris, FrancePhone: +33 1 40 49 48 14Website \\n Paris has over 100 museums, but arguably none are more beautiful than the Musée d\\'Orsay, which is housed in an old railway station featuring stunning Beaux-Arts architecture.

At this 1,979-seat opera house, you can watch ballets, operas, and concerts from your perch in the historic building, which was built in 1875 at the request of Emperor Napoleon III. Or, if the opera isn\\'t your thing, spend the day exploring the elaborate and extravagant building. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Père Lachaise Cemetery\\n\\n Address: 16 Rue du Repos, 75020 Paris, FrancePhone: +33 1 55 25 82 10Website \\n Visiting a cemetery may sound like an odd thing to do on vacation, but there is arguably no more peaceful place in Paris than the cemeteries.

Here, walking paths circle around fountains, sculptures, elaborate flower beds, and lush grassy knolls. It is a garden fit for a queen, which is exactly why it was built — the park was created beginning in 1612 by the widow of King Henry IV. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Palace of Versailles\\n\\n Address: Place d\\'Armes, 78000 Versailles, FrancePhone: +33 1 30 83 78 00Website \\n The Palace of Versailles sits just on the outskirts of Paris in the city of Versailles.

It\\'s centrally located, has myriad boutiques, galleries, and cafés — and excellent food (don\\'t miss falafel at L\\'As du Fallafel on Rue des Rosiers). In addition to having plenty to do, the feel of the neighborhood is undeniably quaint — winding, cobblestone streets are lined with old buildings and hidden courtyards. \\n Montmartre — 18th arrondissement: Montmartre has housed and inspired artists for decades — including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Pablo Picasso — and today, it is just as inspiring. You\\'ll find arty cafés, cobblestone streets, history buildings, and from the steps of Sacré-Cœur, stunning views over the city. \\n The Latin Quarter - 5th arrondissement: The Latin Quarter is home to the Sorbonne University, so as you might expect, you\\'ll find students roaming the streets and pouring over books in hip cafes. Here, you\\'ll find plenty of old buildings and venues bustling with life — jazz clubs, bars, and historic restaurants. \\n Île de la Cité and Île Saint-Louis — 5th arrondissement: You\\'ll find these two islands smack dab in the middle of Paris on the Seine river. Île de la Cité is the historic center of Paris and is home to Notre-Dame and Sainte-Chapelle, while the quieter Île Saint-Louis has shops and restaurants sprinkled among historic buildings and streets. \\n Saint-Germain-des-Prés — 6th arrondissement: This neighborhood, with its narrow cobblestone streets, unbelievably cute café patios, and designer shops is probably exactly what you imagined Paris to be like. There is arguably no better place to sip on a glass of wine and people watch the afternoon away. \\n Belleville — 20th arrondissement: If you\\'re looking for a different Paris than what you\\'ll find in the tourist-laden neighborhoods down south, head to Belleville. It\\'s where Chinatown meets hipster-town, the food is cheaper (and arguably, better), and buildings are covered with vibrant street art. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring: Paris comes to life in the spring, but the weather can still be a little cool — high 50s to high 60s — and you might catch some light rain. \\n Summer: The summer is definitely Paris\\' high season, with June and July ideal (yet busy) months to visit. In August, many Parisians take their own vacation, so the city will be a little less lively. \\n Fall: Fall in Paris can be beautiful, with temperatures that range from the low 40s to mid 50s and a handful of rainy days a month. \\n Winter: The winter months can be grey and chilly in Paris (sometimes with a dusting of snow!), but it\\'s the perfect time to visit if you want to avoid the crowds and dress in layers, which always has a super-chic effect. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Uber: Ride hailing, electric bikes and motorized scooters, food deliveryiOs | Android \\n Google Translate: word translation with offline capabilitiesiOs | Android \\n Paris Metro Map and Routes: Paris metro map, route planning, route updatesiOs | Android \\n TheFork: Guide to restaurants, in-app table reservationsiOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'rabbit75_ist/Getty Images \\n With its rich history and a food scene that just keeps getting better, a trip to Philadelphia can be a real treat. \\n It\\'s the nation\\'s first UNESCO World Heritage City (because both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were signed here) and is the perfect destination for anyone enthusiastic about the birth of the United States. Stop by Independence National Historic Park to learn all you can about the country\\'s founding, and wear your red, white, and blue with pride on Independence Day at the Wawa Welcome America Festival, the largest July 4 celebration in the county. \\n Foodies can stop by South Philly Barbacoa for delicious slow-cooked lamb or pop into Vedge, a restaurant that works \"magic with vegetables,\" according to Cara Schneider Bongiorno, the founder of Philly History Pops Ups and former media relations director at Visit Philadelphia. Those looking to take their own ingredients home will love the 9th Street Italian Market, which sells everything from artisanal cheeses to pastries. \\n When you visit Philadelphia, you\\'re visiting a city that feels gravid with its history in a way that some equally storied cities don\\'t quite manage. There\\'s a lot about the city of brotherly (and sisterly) love to, well, love. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n One of Travel + Leisure\\'s best new hotels in 2020, the Four Seasons Philadelphia brings modernity to this historic city. Home to fine-dining options from award-winning chefs, an infinity-edge pool on the 57th floor, and \"luxe accents, from dazzling arrangements by celebrity florist Jeff Leatham to the sparkling spa, whose walls are embedded with healing crystals,\" as T+L previously reported, this hotel is one of the most luxurious stays in the area. Schneider Bongiorno told T+L that \"the glass elevator up to the sky-high lobby is a total thrill. (But, look the other way if you don\\'t\\xa0like\\xa0that kind of thrill.)\" \\n A luxurious hotel alongside Rittenhouse Square, The Rittenhouse combines timeless luxury with modern amenities in a sophisticated balance. Family friendly and centrally located, the hotel is a classic luxury experience from decor to amenities. \"Drink in the stately old vibe of Rittenhouse Square in the Library Bar, tucked away in the far side of the lobby,\" Schneider Bongiorno added. \\n If you\\'re looking for an experience that isn\\'t quite as rote as a standard hotel, consider Lokal Hotel, an apartment hotel comprised of six thoughtfully curated studio suites. With an excellent location and a true home-away-from-home feel, this Fishtown favorite is in high demand during the height of tourist season. \\n A few streets over is Hotel Monaco\\'s sister, Hotel Palomar, an equally gorgeous but somewhat more serene stay. If Hotel Monaco is color and texture, Hotel Palomar is muted and calm, a true oasis away from the bustling Center City. \\n The Touraine is actually a historical landmark apartment building, and prospective residents jostle for the opportunity to move in permanently any time there is an opening. Lucky for us, The Touraine has several \"travel apartments,\" gorgeously decorated suites that can be rented for short-term stays by visitors. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n This park contains the Liberty Bell and rubs shoulders with Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed. The park itself has played host to suffragettes, civil rights leaders, and more, gathering to protest for expanded rights and liberty for all. Cara Schneider Bongiorno recommends that tourists pick the tour or park location that they find most interesting, but to \"listen with the mindset of how\\xa0radical\\xa0the founding of the United States was when there wasn\\'t a country in the world that chose to let the people govern.\" \\n A museum with a stunning collection, including works by Picasso, Renoir, Van Gogh, Modigliani, and more. On display is also a selection of Native American arts and textiles, African sculpture and arts, and an arboretum replete with rare plants. \\n The Philadelphia Museum of Art is, most importantly, home to the \"Rocky steps\" — the staircase Rocky Balboa ran up in his self-titled film. (You can run up them, too, and don\\'t forget to take a picture at the top.) In addition to that unbeatable cultural icon, the Philadelphia Museum of Art features works by Mary Cassatt, Henri Matisse, Georgia O\\'Keefe, Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, and many more. \\n Built in the Gothic architectural style, this decommissioned prison once housed Al Capone and is allegedly one of the most haunted places in America. These days, Eastern State Penitentiary is a nonprofit dedicated to educating and exploring the history of American criminal justice reform. The Penitentiary offers regular tours and exhibits and, around Halloween, partially transforms into a haunted house. \\n Opened in 1874, the Philadelphia Zoo is devoted to conservation and education through experiences with animals. With more than 1,300 animals, it\\'s easy to spend an entire day here, enjoying the company of giraffes, rhinos, chimpanzees, and more. Schneider Bongiorno recommends guests \"look up and watch for animals as they wander through the overhead\\xa0trail system.\" \\n Read More: 25 Best Things to Do in Philadelphia, According to a Local \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Reading Terminal Market is one of America\\'s oldest and largest markets, continuously operating since 1893 and home not only to specialty and grocery shops but bars and restaurants. Here, you\\'ll find not only fresh ingredients but the tools to make a delicious meal: kitchenware, linens, cookbooks, and more. Reading Terminal Market has \"so much food to choose from.\\xa0It\\'s the ultimate\\xa0place to get a taste of Philly as a tourist,\" said Kurt Evans, chef, activist, partner of\\xa0CYL Hospitality Group, and founder of\\xa0EMI Dinner and\\xa0Everybody Eats. \"Whenever I go, [I visit] Ma Lessie\\'s Chicken & Waffles and get the fried fish and cabbage.\" \\n This 100-year-old community space has a rich history of immigrant families, and part of its mission is to continue to foster and build the community that first began over a century ago. When you shop here — and shop here you should, for fresh and delicious cheeses, baked goods, flowers, seafood, vintage finds, and everything else you can think of — you\\'re part of a century-old tradition. \\n Established in 1851, Jeweler\\'s Row is historically specific to, well, jewelry, but has branched out a bit in recent years to include swanky restaurants and salons. While it\\'s a perfect place to find a one of a kind gem (literally) for yourself or as a gift, Jeweler\\'s Row is fun to explore even if jewelry isn\\'t on your shopping list. \\n This beloved Philadelphia institution lives by the motto \"Cool People. Dope Books. Great Coffee.\" and lives up to all three of those promises. With a fun and eclectic event schedule, a thoughtfully curated selection of books, and a seriously delicious cafe, Uncle Bobbie\\'s should be top of the list for any visitor with a love of books, coffee, or cool people. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Zahav, named an outstanding restaurant by the James Beard Foundation in 2019 and labeled as the best restaurant in America by T+L that same year, is Israel-born chef Michael Solomonov\\'s first restaurant in Philadelphia (he now owns nine). Guests are treated to a five-course prix-fixe menu, which includes delicious breads and mezzes, a choice of entrée (try the famous pomegranate lamb shoulder), and ends with dessert. The meal costs $75 per person, and you will need to make reservations well in advance. \\n If the $200 prix-fixe menu at Jean Georges Philadelphia isn\\'t for you, head upstairs to the 60th floor of the Four Seasons Philadelphia where you\\'ll find the JG Skyhigh Lounge. The lounge is Jean-Georges Vongerichten\\'s first a la carte restaurant in Philadelphia and offers snacks and small plates. Sip on a cocktail, like a lychee raspberry bellini, at the bar, and soak in the incredible view. \\n Suraya is a Lebanese eatery with a cult following in Philadelphia\\'s Fishtown neighborhood. If you don\\'t have your heart set on something specific, definitely go for the tasting menu — at $75 for two people, it\\'s a great option to taste an abundance of what Suraya has to offer. \"Don\\'t miss the Lebanese chai latte made with salep, or orchid powder, and topped with pistachios and rose petals,\" T+L editors have previously recommended. \"It\\'s exactly the right amount of sweet and, devastatingly, impossible to replicate at home.\" \\n Laser Wolf is one of the best Middle Eastern meals in all of Pennsylvania, and the three-course prix-fixe menu is a must-try (prices start at $37). Also created by chef Michael Solomonov, Laser Wolf\\'s best dishes are its traditional ones, like savory kebabs, whole branzino on the grill, and braised short ribs. \"This is how people in Israel actually eat,\" Andrew Henshaw, the executive chef of Laser Wolf, previously told T+L, \"It\\'s like the pub in England or the diner in America.\" They are known for their excellent cocktail pairings, too. \\n Luscious, seasonal vegan and vegetarian dishes are given the star treatment at this former mansion. Come ready for fresh vegetables, house-made pickles, and a shifting menu that gives you a unique experience with every visit. \\n One word: tacos. South Philly Barbacoa is a roaming pop-up that appears in cities nationwide, but lives in Philadelphia full-time. Their pop-ups elsewhere sell out almost immediately, and there is almost always a line at the Philly location, but it\\'s worth it. \"The unusual hours for chef and activist Cristina Martinez\\'s South Philly Barbacoa (open Saturdays and Sundays, from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. or sellout, and Mondays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. or sellout) are due to the time it takes to slow-roast the lamb,\" Schneider Bongiorno said.\\xa0Kurt Evans also gave a glowing review of the lamb, and said that the dish itself is \"worth a trip to Philly\" for. Cash only. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Philadelphia is from March to May when temperatures are mild and crowds are small. Spring brings many fun events to the city, including the Philadelphia Flower Show, the U.S.\\'s largest flower show that takes place every March, and the Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival, where you can celebrate Japanese culture through food and music every April. \\n If you\\'re comfortable with higher temperatures and larger crowds, you can visit in the summer to experience the city\\'s Pride March and Festival, Juneteenth Festival, and the Wawa Welcome America Festival, the largest July 4 celebration in the county. \\n If you can brave the winter chill, you can enjoy the city\\'s many holiday decorations and events. \"The Christmas Village in Philadelphia is probably the closest you can get to an authentic German Christmas market in the U.S.,\" T+L contributor Skye Sherman said previously. \"Enjoy thousands of twinkling lights and the heartwarming scent of waffles, gingerbread, and bratwurst in the air — best washed down with a cup of hot mulled wine.\" \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Philadelphia for Fun Events, Fewer Crowds, and Beautiful Weather \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n You can fly into Philadelphia International Airport from over 140 different destinations and on every major U.S. airline. Once you arrive, hop on the SEPTA Airport Rail Line — it\\'ll take you north to Center City and beyond, depending on where you need to be. \\n If you\\'re visiting from the Northeast, you can opt to take the train to the city instead of flying in — Amtrak offers two lines that run through Philadelphia, the Keystone Service route, which runs from New York to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and the Acela route, which runs from Boston to D.C. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Center City: Center City could be considered the main hub of Philadelphia in the way that Times Square is the most iconic area of New York. It\\'s home to some of the city\\'s most iconic attractions, including the Liberty Bell, Barnes Foundation, Independence Hall, and Franklin Institute. \"Numbered streets run north to south and tree or named streets run east to west.\" Cara Schneider Bongiorno says,\\xa0\"The river trails on each side (scenic Schuylkill on the West; bustling Delaware on the East) are worth a walk or run as well.\" \\n Logan Square: Center City is broken up into smaller neighborhoods, and Logan Square is one of these. Home to the Barnes Foundation and the Franklin Institute, Logan Square is also where you\\'ll find the iconic LOVE sculpture — if you\\'re going to Philadelphia, a selfie with this sculpture is the ultimate in gotta-do-it cheesy-fun tourist experiences. \\n Rittenhouse Square: Located within Center City, Rittenhouse Square is one of Philadelphia\\'s most fashionable neighborhoods. If your interest is in chic shopping and high-profile restaurants, make your way to this beautiful, idyllic enclave of Philadelphia\\'s bustling heart. Walnut Street, the heart of the neighborhood, features art galleries, fashion boutiques, and spas. Cara Schneider Bongiorno recommends tourists \"stroll through or people watch from the sidewalk cafés on 18th Street.\" \\n Fishtown: Fishtown is by far the coolest of Philadelphia\\'s many neighborhoods. Formerly a working-class neighborhood home to — you guessed it – sailors and fishermen, Fishtown has become an enclave of creative, youthful energy. Trends in fashion, art, and food start here, and this is the place to be for the trendiest bars, restaurants, and nightlife. \"Notice the decorative fish everywhere,\" Cara Schneider Bongiorno says. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Transit in Philadelphia is maintained by SEPTA, which runs trains, buses, and trolleys. These are all paid for either through SEPTA\\'s Travel Wallet program and a SEPTA Key card, or with cash in hand. You can reload your card at one of the many SEPTA kiosks, which accepts cash, credit, debit, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. SEPTA is in the process of a five-year transportation revitalization program called SEPTA Forward. With this program, the transit company hopes to create a unified and equitable transit network. Download the SEPTA app for on-the-go access to schedule information, fare options, and more. \\n Trains: Philly\\'s rapid transit system combines subway lines, buses, and trolleys to get you where you need to go. The subways run out of two major lines, the Broad Street Line and Market-Frankfort Line. Together, these lines are quite comprehensive, making Philly a highly navigable city. \\n Buses: What you can\\'t reach by subway, you can probably reach by bus — the lines are connected through SEPTA, and you can easily transfer from one mode to the other. SEPTA is constructing a new transit hub on Ridge Avenue to help with wait times and congestion. \\n Trolleys: Of course, the trackless trolleys are the most fun way to travel around Philly, just for the sheer novelty. They are also connected through SEPTA, making for easy transfer. \\n Taxis: Taxis are abundant in Philadelphia and can be hailed from most main streets. \\n Car service: Lyft and Uber are available in Philadelphia, and independently owned car services are also available — the most popular is Philly Black Car. \\n',\n",
              "  'If you\\'re looking for a quieter experience that nevertheless is as beautiful, fun, and vibrant as her more famous sister, Pittsburgh is the way to go. There\\'s no other city quite like it in structure — driving in through the mountains feels like you\\'ve passed into another world, a little greener and more beautiful than the one you left behind. The city sits where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers come together to form the Ohio River, and so it is criss-crossed by some of the more beautiful American bridges. \\n Beyond the refreshing city design and unique geography, Pittsburgh is home to a host of true gems of tourism, shopping, and dining. From the Carnegie Library and Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, to the wonderful shopping and dining in Shadyside, Pittsburgh is a city worthy of spending your time in. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Like many eastern cities, Pittsburgh is most enjoyable in more temperate seasons – spring and fall are exceptionally beautiful and full of things to do.

You can\\'t go wrong — anytime you visit, Pittsburgh will have something going on for you to enjoy. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n You can absolutely get around Pittsburgh via public transportation, but you\\'ll probably enjoy your visit most if you rent a car.

Sports are huge in Pittsburgh. There\\'s no basketball team, but football and hockey enjoy huge fanbases, and sports bars and merch shops abound. Take the Gateway Clipper Ferry for a fun and scenic way of getting to the stadiums. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Pittsburgh\\'s light rail is called the T. Pay before you board, or sign up for a ConnectCard before you go. You can transfer between the airport shuttle, the 28X, and the T (or any bus stop) for $1, but you do need to tell the operator if you\\'re paying with cash and not a ConnectCard. Travel between Downtown and the North Shore is always free. You can get a map of the light rail system here. It\\'s more similar to San Francisco or Washington DC than New York City or London in terms of how many stops it services, but all of the major points are reachable via the T. \\n Buses: Pittsburgh\\'s bus system is pretty robust thanks to the universities within the city. Bus stops are marked by blue and white signs. ConnectCards also work on the buses, or you can pay your fare — $2.75 flat — in exact change, as bus drivers do not carry any. \\n Taxis: The primary taxi service in Pittsburgh is zTrip, and you can use their app or call them at (412) 777-7777 to order a car. Otherwise, taxis can be hailed just as anywhere else in the US, by standing close to the curb and lifting your hand. \\n Car service: Uber and Lyft are always good options for transportation, especially in a drive-heavy city like Pittsburgh. Rides are plentiful and, as always, you can order a private car or join a carpool. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel\\n\\n Address: 107 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222Phone: (412) 562-1200Book Now \\n Part of the Marriott family of hotels, the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel offers luxury accommodation in easy reach of everything there is to do in the city.

Whether it\\'s strolling through any one of the 275 public parks and gardens or kayaking down the Willamette River that cuts through the heart of the city, there\\'s endless options to do some outdoor exploring. And with nearly 400 miles of bikeways it\\'s no surprise that Portland is considered the biking capital of the country. \\n Even though this West Coast hub gets significantly more rain than the majority of the country, you won\\'t find yourself stuck inside waiting out the bad weather. There\\'s an eclectic mix of neighborhoods each with its own unique vibe. From high-end shopping Downtown to vintage boutiques in the city\\'s Southeast quadrant and fine dining restaurants in Nob Hill and the Pearl District to casual eateries in Division, there\\'s really something for everyone. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time. (Daylight Savings Time is observed seasonally) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The summer months are when Portland really shines. With consistent warm weather and lighter than average rainfall from June to August, the city\\'s vibrant outdoor scene really kicks into high gear. Residents take advantage of the nicer days with an impressive selection of outdoor dining options and loads of great festivals, including the Waterfront Blues Festival and the Portland Rose Festival each June, and in July, there\\'s the Oregon Brewers Festival and the Big Float, where upwards of 70,000 people descend on the city\\'s waterfront for a massive people-powered flotilla and beach party. \\n But the summer isn\\'t the only time to visit the City of Roses as pleasant weather stretches into the early fall months making September and October just as good a time to check out the area. But come mid-October, that\\'s when the rainy season starts, and unpredictable weather stretches into early May. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Portland has one of the strongest beer scenes in the country with over 70 microbreweries in the greater metro area. But while beer might be the first drink that people think of when planning a trip to the area, they also have a stand out wine scene. Just to the south of Portland, in the Willamette Valley (pronounced Wuh-la-muht), you\\'ll find around 80 wineries and over 200 vineyards that produce the majority of the state\\'s acclaimed wine. \\n For those who prefer coffee, the city has even more independent coffee roasters than they do breweries with 80 in the city limits alone. \\n Known for its commitment to healthy living, Portland was named a \"platinum\" bicycle-friendly community by the League of American Bicyclists partly due to its 385 miles of bikeways and its bike share system called Biketown. \\n Oregon is one of only two states, the other being New Jersey, where it\\'s illegal to pump your own gas. The state is also one of five states that do not impose a sales tax, including Alaska, Delaware, Montana, and New Hampshire. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Portland\\'s TriMet public transportation system offers light rail, bus, and streetcar service throughout the city and into the surrounding metro area.

              "  'Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure \\n Puerto Rico has a little something for everyone. Beach vacationers will find clean, white-sand beaches lined with palm trees, while history buffs will love Old San Juan, with its cobblestone streets and brightly painted colonial buildings sandwiched between centuries-old fortresses. Those looking for adventure won\\'t have to go far. There\\'s surfing, snorkeling off uninhabited islands, and glowing bioluminescent waters. And in El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest in the national forest system, travelers can access 24 miles of hiking trails leading to waterfalls, swimming holes, and mountain peaks. \\n Plus, travel to Puerto Rico is noticeably easier and breezier than most other Caribbean islands. Because it\\'s a U.S. territory, you don\\'t need a passport or have to worry about exchanging money (they use the U.S. dollar). English is widely spoken, and there are direct flights from several U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Buffalo, and St. Louis (in addition to most major cities in Florida). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go to Puerto Rico\\n\\n Most travelers head to Puerto Rico in the winter, when the rainy hurricane season has passed and a tropical escape is top of mind. And while there\\'s nothing wrong with a mid-winter beach escape (sign us up!), winter is also the island\\'s busy season. Head to Puerto Rico between mid-April and June to avoid sky-high rates and crowded beaches. During this short but blissful window, you\\'ll avoid the winter crowds and the hurricane season. \\n Rain does tend to be more common starting in April, but it\\'s usually paired with milder weather in the mid 80s and plenty of sunny, bluebird days. Just pack a raincoat and have a plan for when the clouds roll in. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do in Puerto Rico\\n\\n Clear-kayak Tour on a Bioluminescent BayAddress: Jak Water Sports, Vieques, 00765Phone: (787) 644-7112Website \\n No trip to Puerto Rico is complete without a visit to the island of Vieques (30 minutes by ferry from the mainland). And while you\\'re there, you\\'ll want to experience the otherworldly, glow-in-the-dark blue of Bioluminescent Bay (a.k.a. Mosquito Bay) after dark. As you glide your clear-bottomed kayak into the bay, the underwater world beneath you will be lit up by the ocean\\'s equivalent of fireflies. To say it\\'s magical is an understatement. \\n Surf Lesson in RincónAddress: Surf Lessons Puerto Rico, Rincón, 00602Phone: (787) 617-4731Website \\n On the far western and northwestern side of the island is a series of surf breaks that have given this part of Puerto Rico the nicknames, the \"Hawaii of the Caribbean,\" and even, the \"Mecca of Surfing.\" Thanks to a year-round break and bathtub-warm waters, everyone from true beginners to old pros will find waves to play in. For a lesson — or a local guide who will take you to the best spots — check out Surf Lessons Puerto Rico, an outfit that\\'s been in operation for over 20 years. \\n Catamaran Tour to Cayo IcacosAddress: East Island Excursions, Marina Puerto Del Rey, Fajardo, 00738Phone: (787) 617-4731Website \\n Just off mainland Puerto Rico is Cayo Icacos, a tiny, uninhabited island with a private, deserted-beach vibe — especially during the quiet season. A day spent on the island is the No. 4 activity in Puerto Rico, according to Tripadvisor travelers, who say the best way to experience the clear waters and white sandy beaches is by catamaran. The 5.5-hour snorkeling tour with East Island Excursions is complemented by the catamaran\\'s underwater windows — perfect for viewing sea life from the ship — and onboard waterslide. \\n El Yunque National ForestAddress: El Yunque National Forest, Río Grande, 00745Phone: (787) 888-1880Website \\n El Yunque National Forest is the only tropical rainforest in the national forest system. The park lives up to the distinction with nearly 29,000 acres of dense rainforest inhabited by geckos, mongoose, bats, and 97 bird species.

The property sits on a boardwalk overlooking the ocean within easy walking distance to beach bars, boutiques, and some of the island\\'s best restaurants.

That means 24-hour butler service and a handful of restaurants overseen by the acclaimed chef Juan Jose Cuevas. And while the service (and food) are excellent, the hotel\\'s history makes it truly stand out. The resort was built in 1919 and is a perfect example of Spanish Revival architecture. The property infuses its history and heritage with all the modern amenities a discerning traveler would expect. \\n Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton ReserveAddress: 100 Dorado Beach Drive, Dorado, 00646Phone: (787) 626-1100Website \\n Just west of San Juan is the sprawling Dorado Beach resort, which sits on 1,400 acres and has two pools, three golf courses, a water park, and a spa and fitness center.

And let\\'s not forget The Ritz-Carlton\\'s exemplary butler service. \\n Lazy Parrot InnAddress: km 4.1, PR-413, Rincón, 00677Phone: (787) 823-5654Website \\n If you want to experience the real Puerto Rico, start with a night or two at the Lazy Parrot Inn, a family-run boutique hotel in the surf town of Rincón. From your perch on the hill above town, you\\'ll have views over the bay (and the surf break), which is a breezy 20-minute walk (or a three-minute drive) from the hotel. Each of the Lazy Parrot\\'s 21 rooms is clean and modern with all the organic touches you\\'d expect from a green, eco-hotel. On-property perks include a saltwater pool and hot tub, farm-to-table fare, and lush gardens. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hurricane Season in Puerto Rico\\n\\n In Puerto Rico, hurricane season typically runs from early June to late November, but historically, many larger storms occur in September. Hurricane season, predictably, aligns with the island\\'s rainy season, which typically starts in April and runs through November. Because of this, tourism to Puerto Rico decreases during these summer and fall months. \\n',\n",

              "  'There are few better beach destinations than Rhode Island. With 400 miles of gorgeous Atlantic shoreline, Rhode Island is a dream for any traveler looking for a classic New England experience — especially if they want that experience to almost always be within walking distance of a beach. If you\\'ve never been to Rhode Island, you might think that the main point of interest is Providence — and while this city is wonderful and well worth your time, you\\'d be missing out on some of the most wonderful parts of the state if you only stayed there. From beaches and museums to the Newport Mansions and award-winning Roger Williams Park Zoo, Rhode Island is full of hidden and not-so-hidden gems that are worth visiting. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Many of Rhode Island\\'s fun activities are outdoors, so while you can really go any time of year, the spring and summer are best, when the weather is mild to warm and nature is at her best. Winter and fall visits are enjoyable as well, but be prepared to spend less time outdoors. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n If you\\'re planning to explore Rhode Island beyond Providence, you\\'ll want to rent a car, as many of the best things to do here are easiest and most enjoyable when you have your own ride. Locals know to get to most of those things early — the Ocean Drive, for instance, is gridlocked by noon, but pleasant at 8 a.m. You can have a cheaper vacation if you spend part of it outside of Providence; there are a ton of smaller inns and bed-and-breakfasts throughout the state that are just as lovely for a fraction of the cost of a metropolitan hotel. Rhode Islanders are friendly, and some of the state shares an accent with Boston (it\\'s different, but to the untrained ear, it\\'ll sound fairly similar). Definitely try Rhode Island institutions: Del\\'s frozen lemonade, a coffee cabinet (like a milkshake, if milkshakes were thicker and somehow more delicious), coffee milk (sweet coffee concentrate plus milk plus the need to have more than one glass), fries with vinegar, and hot dogs with celery salt. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) runs regular service from Boston through Rhode Island, if you\\'re looking for local stops. Otherwise, Amtrak services Providence, Kingston, and Westerly. \\n Buses: If you don\\'t have your own car, the main way to get around Rhode Island is with RIPTA, Rhode Island Public Transit Authority\\'s bus systems. Daily unlimited passes are $6; otherwise, it\\'s $2 per trip. \\n Taxis: Taxis are available throughout the state, though a call in advance is required in non-metropolitan areas. Rachel\\'s Big City Transportation is a favorite around Providence. \\n Car Service: Lyft and Uber are available as usual throughout Rhode Island. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Weekapaug Inn\\n\\n Address: 25 Spray Rock Road, Westerly, RI 02891Phone: (855) 679-2995Website \\n The Weekapaug Inn is a favorite for travelers looking to enjoy chic New England charm during their Rhode Island visit.

The art deco-statue was built by a French sculptor in 1931, and the statue's arms stretch out a massive 92 feet wide. You can see the statue from multiple vantage points in Rio, but it's worth the cable ride up the mountain to see it up close. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ipanema Beach\\n\\n Address: Posto 8 through Posto 12 on the beach \\n A close second only to Copacabana Beach in popularity, Ipanema Beach has been a locals' and tourist favorite since at least the '60s. The two-mile stretch of sand features mountain views and cobalt water.

Think of Rio more like a collection of small beach and mountain towns, and it's less overwhelming. Copacabana and Ipanema are obvious beach neighborhoods, but a tram ride up to Santa Teresa is worth it for the boho vibe, ocean views, and samba clubs. Leblon is the neighborhood for pure glitz and glamour and the small footprint means you can check out most of the high end boutiques and chi-chi wine bars in one visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Rio is known for its beaches, and thankfully the weather usually cooperates enough to enjoy them year round. January through March sees temperatures in the low 90s—it's too hot to do much of anything besides swim. July, August, and September are the coolest months with lows in the mid 60s, but also the driest. Hurricanes are a rarity in Rio de Janeiro. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n WhatsApp: Free messaging, video calls, making dinner reservationsAndroid | iOs \\n ChefsClub: Find restaurants, bars, and make reservationsAndroid (not on Android) | iOs \\n Bravolol Limited: Look up words and sentences in Portuguese, translateAndroid | iOs \\n\",\n",
              "  'Just south of Cancún sits Mexico\\'s Riviera Maya, a region full of tempting travel offerings. Here, visitors will find one of the world\\'s largest barrier reefs lurking just off the coast, Mayan ruins touching powder-soft sand in Tulum, a buzzing nightlife scene in Playa del Carmen, and sea turtles floating majestically in the waters of Akumal. Throw in miles and miles of pristine beaches and it\\'s easy to see why this Mexican Caribbean coastal gem draws hordes of admirers. Ready to be one of them? Pack your swimwear and bookmark our curated guide to this deservedly hyped region in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Times to Visit the Riviera Maya\\n\\n Sun-seekers will appreciate the Riviera Maya\\'s year-round rays. However, if you\\'re particular about your weather, there are a few things to keep in mind. \\n January through March visitors can expect a more temperate climate, with temperatures ranging from about 73 F to 77 F. Rainy days are rather rare during this time, with January averaging five days of rain and February and March averaging just three. \\n April and May bring in hotter days, with the average temperature hitting 79 to 81 F. The rain is minimal, however, there may be one unwanted guest in the spring months: the foul-smelling brown sargassum seaweed that infests beaches seasonally. \\n June, July, and August can feel sweltering, with average temperatures peaking at 82 F. And, though the threat is relatively low, June to October is officially hurricane season in Rivera Maya. \\n November and December usher in the more pleasant temperatures again, pulling back to 77 F to 75 F respectively. So really, the best time to visit is whenever feels best to you. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do in the Riviera Maya\\n\\n If you\\'re wondering where to go in the Riviera Maya for a bit of shopping and nightlife, look to the largest city in the region: Playa del Carmen. \\n The downtown area is remarkably pedestrian-friendly, with boutiques, restaurants, bars, and tequila museums dotted along Quinta Avenida, a.k.a. its \"Fifth Avenue.\" In Playa, scorching days at the various beach clubs — Martina, Lido, and Zenzi — turn into balmy nights at thumping nightlife establishments, many of which are concentrated around Twelfth Street. \\n Travelers can also plot out a number of day trips around the Riviera Maya right from vendors in Playa del Carmen, including excursions trips to Cozumel, a bonafide snorkeling and diving mecca. \\n The island is located on the Mesoamerican Reef — the largest barrier reef system in the Atlantic Ocean — which dazzles all the way from Mexico\\'s coast to Belize, Guatemala, and the Bay Islands of Honduras. To get to Cozumel, two companies (Ultramar and Winjet) operate fast ferries from the dock close to Parque Los Fundadores. \\n The Mayan ruins at Cobá and Chichén Itzá also make fantastic day expeditions, with the former housing a 120-step pyramid called Nohoch Mul, which offers awe-inspiring jungle views from the summit. The latter, Chichén Itzá, is further inland and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its most famous monument (El Castillo) has 365 steps for each day in the solar year (climbing them is not permitted). Chichén Itzá is also one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. \\n Beautiful Bacalar warrants a longer trip to explore the Lagoon of Seven Colors (Laguna de Los Siete Colores), named for the varying shades of blue of its crystalline waters. On a clear, sunny day, you\\'ll do no better than kayaking, swimming, or taking a boat around the lagoon. The rest of this laid-back \"Magic Town\" (Pueblo Mágico) is a pleasure to discover on foot. \\n Enlightenment-seekers may want to spend a little extra time in Tulum. It\\'s a destination filled with loveable contradictions. It\\'s spiritual yet hedonistic, boho yet affluent. It\\'s a place where Yoga studios, healing pre-Hispanic temazcal sweat lodges, and electronic music-fueled nights coexist. \\n Tulum is also brimming with Instagram-friendly eye candy, including the Ahau Tulum\\'s Ven a Luz sculpture, the \"Follow that dream\" sign at the Lolita Lolita Tulum boutique, and the whitewashed swings at Coco Beach Club. Of course, all its beaches are equally picture-perfect, though the unmissable beach experience in Tulum is the archaeological site at Playa Ruinas. The clifftop Mayan ruin overlooking the impossibly blue waters of the Caribbean makes this a unique sandy spot. \\n For sand-free swimming, make your way to the plethora of cenotes between Tulum and Playa del Carmen. Ancient Mayans believed these natural pools to be gateways to the underworld, and there are thousands spread around the Mexican Caribbean in all shapes and sizes: Some are bat-filled and enclosed, others are open-air and permit diving or cliff jumping. Jardin del Eden, Cenote Azul, and Dos Ojos are extremely popular. Don\\'t leave Riviera Maya without dipping in one of these limestone sinkholes. \\n Those looking for animal encounters with their swim should head to Akumal, a beach town located between Tulum and Playa del Carmen. Akumal is Maya for \"place of the turtles,\" which means there will be plenty of flippered friends waiting for you. Come face-to-face with them on a self-guided tour by swimming out from the dreamy white sand beach at Lol-Ha restaurant. \\n If you feel a call to adventure, high-octane hijinks are offered at any of Xcaret Group\\'s all-inclusive eco-parks sprinkled across the Riviera Maya. Slither down a 131-foot lighthouse slide at Xel-Há, take to the water on a floating trajinera for a culture-filled Mexican party at Xoximilco, or zipline with the wind in your hair through the jungle at XPlor. \\n One more must-see spot is Sian Ka\\'an Biosphere, the largest protected natural area in the Mexican Caribbean. Come to paddleboard, kayak, swim, and hike through 2,000 square miles of lagoons, pristine rainforests, beaches, cenotes, and fauna-filled wetlands. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay in the Riviera Maya\\n\\n Travelers to the Riviera Maya are spoiled with choice when it comes to accommodations.Just north of Playa del Carmen, visitors can indulge in the finest with a stay at Rosewood Mayakoba, where boats usher guests to their suites via winding canals. The resort\\'s recently unveiled bi-level wellness suites are worth booking if only for the moon-aligned aromatherapy program alone that\\'s part of the turndown service.Hotel Xcaret Arte is made for those looking to unplug and never, ever, leave the resort. This adults-only, all-inclusive property in Playa del Carmen offers guests the chance to participate in activities like art workshops and allows for unlimited access to each exhilarating Xcaret Group park. \\n For sleek rooftop pool lounging, downtown hotels Thompson Playa del Carmen and The Fives don\\'t disappoint, but if it\\'s a center-of-the-action beachfront experience you\\'re after, check into Hilton Playa del Carmen. \\n In Tulum, Papaya Playa Project is achingly cool with thatched villas, a beach club packed with digital nomads by day and stylish clubbers at night, and a robust calendar of wellness events. \\n Nômade Tulum also favors the health-conscious with cacao ceremonies, spiritual talks, yoga classes complete with a live DJ soundtrack, and opportunities for nourishment by warm Caribbean winds at the hotel\\'s treehouse lodgings. \\n For an art-filled getaway, book a few nights in Tulum\\'s Casa Malca, the former summer home of Pablo Escobar that has been lovingly transformed into a boutique hotel that also boats original pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Holton Rower, and a bronze sculpture by KAWS. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get to the Riviera Maya\\n\\n Flights to the Riviera Maya from the U.S. are plentiful with all major U.S. airlines offering direct flights from Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Houston, Chicago, and more. Cancún International Airport (CUN), Mexico\\'s second-largest airport, will be your gateway to adventures in the region with daily direct flights. The island of Cozumel also has a small airport (CZM), which serves both international and domestic airlines. \\n From the airport, travelers can hire a car with Hertz, Avis, or Europcar (and a host of others), take a taxi, or hop on the low cost and ever-reliable ADO Bus shuttle that runs directly to both Playa del Carmen and Tulum. \\n',\n",
              "  'It famously straddles seven hills, but Rome often feels like several cities. There\\'s the ancient one, of course – the Rome of emperors and amphitheaters, still visible today. Then there\\'s grand, baroque Rome, a city of immense squares, florid churches and fountains, each more spectacular than the next. There\\'s the Dolce Vita vibe, still, in elegant boutiques, bars, and restaurants, and landmark hotels still on Via Veneto. But Rome is also modern, with formerly residential neighborhoods such as Testaccio, Monti, and Ostiense now as attractive to tourists for their nightlife as the classic areas. \\n It all swirls together into one timeless gumbo. In the space of a day you can go from a Roman emperor\\'s home to a hipster market; you can peel away the layers simply by stepping down into the basement of a church. Of course, all this excess needs some restraint. You should find that in the Vatican; but instead, you\\'ll find Michelangelo\\'s Sistine Chapel there. So when it all gets too much, there are the parks: the Giardino degli Aranci with its sublime views of the dome of St Peter\\'s; the Villa Borghese, whose sprawling grounds contain several museums; and the Via Appia Antica, a Roman road strewn with mausoleums, catacombs, and ancient aqueducts. Even out in nature, Rome can\\'t help but go over the top. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Fall is famously stunning in Rome, known for soft-lit afternoons and a warming sun.

The marble-clad interiors are glorious, but even they\\'re outshone by the contents: a room full of Caravaggios and the hall of lifelike Bernini sculptures for starters. \\n Address: Piazza Augusto Imperatore, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyWebsite \\n The mausoleum of Rome\\'s first emperor, Augustus, was once the grandest, highest building in the city. Over the centuries it lost its marble cladding, its roof and much of its elegance, but following a 13-year restoration it reopened to the public in 2021 – ancient Rome\\'s newest site. \\n The Tiber has one of Europe\\'s loveliest riversides, studded with historical remains and buildings and shaded by trees. The stretch from the Foro Boario – where two ancient temples sit opposite the Bocca della Verità – up to the marble Ponte Sisto, is lovely, passing the grand synagogue and the mid-river island, Isola Tiberina. Or go from the grand Piazza del Popolo, past the Mausoleo di Augusto and the ancient Ara Pacis monument, across the Roman bridge to the Castel Sant\\'Angelo – the castle-like mausoleum of the emperor Hadrian, which then became the Pope\\'s fortress. \\n Address: Via Labicana, 95, 00184 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: + 39 06 774 0021Website \\n This church not far from the Colosseum is a prime example of Rome\\'s layered history – and here you\\'ll get to peel back time, tier by tier. The current church is medieval; underneath is an early Christian basilica from the fourth century; and below that is a mithraeum (an ancient Roman temple) and a Roman house. \\n Address: Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, 00153 Roma RM, ItalyWebsite \\n It\\'s just off the tourist map (literally), beyond the Circus Maximus, which means this jaw-dropping Roman bath complex is rarely visited. Wander the sprawling complex to see mosaics still in situ, hulking walls and arches, and – if it\\'s having a special opening – the underground mithraeum. \\n Address: Foro Traiano, 85, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 2276 1280Website \\n This lesser known site has a fantastic sound-and-light show taking you straight back to ancient Rome. Ruined Roman houses in the bowels of a grand palazzo have not only been excavated – so you walk above them on glass floors – but projectors show you how it would have been 2,000 years ago. \\n Address: Via Vittorio Veneto, 27, 00187 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 8880 3695Website \\n A memento mori warning to the Dolce Vita set, this church crypt on the famous Via Veneto houses the remains of 3,700 bodies – assumed to be capuchin monks. But it isn\\'t gruesome – the bones and skulls have been arranged artistically, into altarpieces, chandeliers, and even a Grim Reaper skeleton brandishing a scythe. \\n Address: Piazza Pietro D\\'Illiria, 00153 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 6710 5457 \\n Follow the avenue of skinny pine trees to watch the sun set over St Peter\\'s. This lovely little park atop the Aventine hill has prime views of the city skyline – and points straight towards Michelangelo\\'s famous dome. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n Address: Via dei Condotti \\n This street – the flashiest in Rome – offers world-class window-shopping. Most designers have branches on Via Condotti (technically Via dei Condotti, though it\\'s never referred to as such) and its cobbled side streets. \\n Address: Via dei Coronari, 57, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 686 4224Website \\n Italy\\'s best known \\'nose\\' and parfumier to the great and good including the Queen of England, Laura has created dozens of exclusive perfumes and scents at her laboratory on trendy Via dei Coronari. \\n Address: Via di Pallacorda, 1, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 689 2401Website \\n Master tailor Piero Albertelli made elegant clothes for royals and celebrities across the globe. Although he passed away in 2018, his team continues, making made-to-measure shirts, coats and sweaters. There\\'s a ready-to-wear collection, too. \\n Address: Via dei Coronari, 197, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 6871645Website \\n Lisa Corti was born and brought up in Ethiopia, and she pays homage to her upbringing with her bright, highly patterned textiles. You\\'ll find everything from throws and curtains to tablecloths and bed covers; as well as interiors there\\'s also a collection of kaftans and kurtas. \\n Address: Via dei Prefetti, 11, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 679 3481Website \\n This eyeglass brand has been going strong since 1961, and it shows in the retro designs. You\\'ll find bright colors, the odd leopard print and even octagonal frames – they\\'re design objects in themselves. \\n Address: Via dei Pianellari, 14, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 335 824 0400Website \\n Artists and artisans tend to have been squeezed out of the city center in recent years. Wood sculptor Ferdinando Codognotto is one of those who remains – his extraordinary works of art can be seen around the city, while his workshop is on a cobbled street behind Piazza Navona. \\n Address: Via dei Chiavari, 39, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 6830 7297Website \\n Elisa Nepi handcrafts brightly colored bags, made from vegetable-dyed Tuscan leather (which she personally selects). Try her two-tone satchels, over-shoulder bags and wallets. \\n Address: Via dei Chiavari, 73, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone : +39 339 272 5780Website \\n Step back in time into this mosaic workshop, where pots of tesserae line the shelves and ancient designs are propped up against the walls. Artisans Tiziana Ferraresi and Francesca Nicosia split the large tesserae over a spiked tree stump – just as the ancient Romans used to do. They teach mosaic classes, too. \\n Address: Via di S. Pantaleo, 68-69, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 06 6880 2547Website \\n \\'Strategic Business Unit\\' isn\\'t the most authentically Italian-sounding name, but these slick jeans, button-downs and t-shirts bear all the hallmarks of Bel Paese fashion. The ultra-soft denim comes from Japan, though it\\'s tailored in Italy. \\n Address: Le Tartarughe Eat & Drink, Piazza Mattei, 00186 Roma RM, ItalyPhone: +39 392 413 2158Website \\n Rita Salvadori grows 80,000 chili pepper plants on her biodynamic Tuscan farm, including some of the spiciest strains on the planet. They\\'re sold here, at this great little café and deli – try her chilli-laced salt and jam. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Trastevere: On the Vatican side of the Tiber – the Ponte Sisto bridge is the entrance point – Trastevere is one of the center\\'s trendiest neighborhoods, with exceptional restaurants and buzzing bars alongside quiet lanes and cobblestone streets that feel far from a city. This has always been an area of artists and artisans, and there\\'s still a boho feel to the air. \\n Testaccio: A port of ancient Rome, this Tiber-side district south of the city center used to be best known as the location for the city\\'s slaughterhouse. Today, that slaughterhouse hosts modern art exhibitions, and there\\'s a slew of trendy bars straddling this and Ostiense, the district next door. As a working class area, its restaurants have always been top-notch. \\n Monti: Hipsters love Monti, the former down-at-heel neighborhood sitting between Termini railway station and the Colosseum. Back in ancient times, this was the Suburra (slums); more recently it was the Red Light district. But in the last couple of decades, its cobblestone streets have been transformed by artisans, bars, and boutique stores, making it Rome\\'s nightlife capital, spiraling off from Piazza della Madonna dei Monti. \\n Vatican City: This is of course the seat of the Catholic faith, and life revolves around the church here in the Vatican, an independent city stage within Rome. You\\'re here for the museums and St Peter\\'s Basilica of course, but there are other finds, such as the Auditorium Conciliazione concert hall and its chic Chorus Caffe. \\n Campitelli: If you\\'re here for all things ancient, this is where you\\'ll spend most of your time. Campitelli is home to the most famous parts of ancient Rome, including the Forum, the Palatine, and the Campidoglio; the Colosseum skims its edge. \\n Campo Marzio: If you\\'re looking to splash some cash, you\\'ll want Campo Marzio. One of the most ancient areas of Rome, it pairs sites such as the Mausoleo di Augusto and the Ara Pacis with the chic shopping streets around Via Condotti and the Spanish Steps, and finishes at Via del Corso, where you\\'ll find the high-street stores. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Fall in Rome is spectacular – so much so that there\\'s a name for the city\\'s warm and sunny October days: ottobrata, where temperatures can hit the 70s in the sun. Winters are mild, although January temperatures can plummet to the 40s, and it can rain. Spring, like fall, is a beautiful time to go, with trees in blossom and temperatures in the 60s. Summer is hot and humid – so much so that most Romans abandon the city for the month of August. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Scooterino: Ride-sharing app to beat Rome\\'s notorious traffic – on a VespaiOs | Android \\n FREE NOW (was MyTaxi): Taxi-hailing appiOs | Android \\n Street Art Roma: Maps out Rome\\'s street artiOs only \\n Probus Rome: Bus schedules, routes, live updatesiOs | Android \\n',\n",

              "  'Makito Umekita/Travel + Leisure \\n There\\'s no denying that, at least in the 21st century, San Francisco is often thought of as the technology hub of America. And it\\'s perfectly true that this city—which is home to Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and countless other technology platforms that impact our daily lives—is synonymous with big tech. However, San Francisco is home to revelatory architecture, the first established LGBTQ+ neighborhood in the country, and Michelin-starred dining, all of which are crucial components of San Francisco\\'s legacy. \\n When in San Francisco, do as the Northern Californians do. Dress in layers, because the weather is constantly changing, and the fog—whose name, by the way, is Karl—often rolls in with little warning. Spend an afternoon lounging in a public park, taking advantage of San Francisco\\'s seemingly endless green space. Take the BART—i.e., the Metro—to dinner in the Mission. Hike along the Pacific Ocean, or at least stroll on Ocean Beach at sunset. And if someone offers to let you test their app in beta, you\\'ve officially made it as a local. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time (Daylight Savings Time observed, timing varies) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Because San Francisco weather is moderate year-round, it\\'s a destination you can visit all 12 months of the year. That being said, San Francisco records its warmest temperatures from June to October. The city tends to see a high season in July and August, which is why we would recommend visiting in May, June, September, or October. Generally, the fall is quieter than the spring and summer, and yet the temperatures are still in the 70s. \\n If you\\'re visiting for a specific event, keep in mind that San Francisco famously hosts Outside Lands Music Festival in August each year, and other notable festivals include the San Francisco International Film Festival (April), Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival (April), and San Francisco Jazz Festival (June). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n San Francisco is home to Golden Gate Park, which is the third most visited park in the U.S. and spans 1,017 acres. \\n San Francisco is a true food town: There are 62 Michelin-starred restaurants in the city, and seven restaurants with three Michelin stars (which is impressive considering there are only 14 three-Michelin-star restaurants in the U.S.).

Marin, Oakland, and Palo Alto are not, though many visiting San Francisco still like to tour or stay in the surrounding areas, especially when coming to town for work. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The BART, or Bay Area Rapid Transit, is San Francisco\\'s heavy rail metro, connecting five counties across 131 miles and 50 stations. It allows those on the greater San Francisco peninsula (in tech hubs like Los Gatos, Palo Alto, or Mountain View) to commute to the city center. It also transports tourists and locals around the city, connecting many of the city\\'s top attractions. Find a BART map here. \\n Buses: The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) operates buses, trains, and historic streetcars, among other essential inter-city transportation. The SFMTA\\'s Muni transportation network includes \"fuel-efficient Muni buses, light rail Metro trains, historic streetcars, and iconic cable cars.\" Find all the Muni bus and light rail stops and routes here.

              "  'San Miguel de Allende may just be the most charming small town in Mexico. It\\'s no pueblito, though, but a colorful, colonial-style city with a vibrant wine scene, markets and artisans galore, and one of the most impressive gastronomic scenes in Mexico. \\n From the second you drop into downtown, you\\'ll see the iconic, pink Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel towering above the lower, Spanish-style buildings sprawled out around the square. Walk around the square, people watch, or duck into the nearby artisan market to pick up handmade goodies. \\n Museums abound in San Miguel, as do shopping offerings in the city; local boutiques here make everything from silk-screen tees to hammered silver jewelry. Once you\\'ve worked up an appetite, you\\'ll have your pick from shrimp tempura on a crunchy tostada, slow-cooked barbacoa from a modest street stand, or Sri Lankan-Swiss-Mexican fusion food all within a few blocks from el centro. \\n Despite being a small town, San Miguel de Allende is filled with things to do, whether you\\'re in town for a day or a week. It\\'s a cultural hub, with plenty of art exhibition spaces and live music performances around town in the evenings. And if you can\\'t fit everything into one trip, you\\'ll just have to come back; you wouldn\\'t be the first foreigner to land in San Miguel permanently. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n San Miguel de Allende is in the central time zone. The country\\'s Daylight Savings calendar deviates from the United States\\', so there are a few weeks a year the U.S. and Mexico central time zones are an hour apart. If you visit in spring or fall, check ahead. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n San Miguel de Allende is packed with activities year-round, and you\\'ll find things to do no matter when you visit. For the best weather, we recommend visiting between November and April when highs hover in the 70s and 80s, though tourists will be out in full force during the Christmas and Easter holidays. It seems like San Miguel is always celebrating something — not just Día de los Muertos (Nov. 1), but the annual wine harvest festival in August, the Guanajuato International Film Festival each July, and of course, the Desfile de los Locos, which literally translated as \"Parade of the Crazies\" and sees Sanmiguelenses dress up in their wackiest outfits to throw candy at onlookers each June. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n San Miguel de Allende — or \"San Mike,\" as some only semi-jokingly call it — is a haven for American expats, bachelorette parties, and retirees. It\\'s an extremely welcoming town, where it\\'s not uncommon to see tourists hanging out with locals in the streets, at market stalls, or even at the bar. \\n It\\'s also a pretty small town, so you likely won\\'t need to worry about transportation, unless you\\'re taking a day trip to nearby attractions, like to Guanajuato or Querétaro, or visiting the lake just outside city limits. Your most common mode of transportation will be on foot — so pack comfy shoes — but be warned that San Miguel\\'s altitude and the hilly terrain can take your breath away, literally. If you\\'d prefer, you can easily flag down a green taxi or call an Uber instead of trekking back up the cobblestone streets. \\n While San Miguel is well-accustomed to tourists — about 10 percent of the population are foreigners — travelers should still be cautious and considerate. Be aware of locals looking to get by in a hurry, and stand to the right on sidewalks. \\n Currency: Mexican Peso (MXN) \\n (Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: Spanish \\n I don\\'t speak Spanish: No hablo español.I\\'m lost: Estoy perdido/aI would like…: Me gustaría... \\n Learn more Spanish phrases \\n Calling Code: +52 \\n Capital City: Mexico City \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Buses: San Miguel\\'s bus station, or terminal, is on the west side of town.

Rates will vary depending on the route and time of day, but a trip shouldn\\'t cost you more than a few pesos. \\n Taxis: It won\\'t be hard to flag down one of San Miguel\\'s quintessential green-and-white taxis in most parts of town. If you\\'re staying downtown, cabs are plentiful. On the outskirts of the city, you may need to head to a main road to hail a cab. \\n Ride service: Uber has an extensive transit web across the city, stretching out into nearby towns. Depending on traffic and trip length, your Uber should come out around 30-100 pesos (or $1.50-$5). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Casa 1810 Hotel Boutique\\n\\n Address: Hidalgo #8 Colonia Centro, San Miguel de Allende 37700 MéxicoPhone: +52 415 121 3501Website \\n This luxury hotel is just a block away from San Miguel\\'s central square, Jardín Allende.

Yes, the 1930s mansion, with its open patio, high wood-beam ceilings, and red terracotta floors, was once a bordello. Run by a woman known as La Turca, this mansion once sheltered local politicians and beatniks… but just for a night. Now, you too can wander the halls of this downtown home before tucking in for the evening. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hacienda El Santuario San Miguel de Allende\\n\\n Address: Aldama 41 & Terraplen 42, San Miguel de Allende 37700 MéxicoPhone: +52 415 152 0335Website \\n Despite being a five-minute walk from the square, this 33-room hacienda feels like a far-removed sanctuary.

And sure, you can order the tacos here, even opting for the seven-ways platter. But you should consider the enchiladas: some served in local fashion, like the potato-stuffed enchiladas al portal, and some a bit less commonly prepared, like the enchiladas a la diabla (spicy!). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Tostévere\\n\\n Address: Codo 4, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5121 3075Website \\n With an unassuming exterior and a hand-scrawled menu, you might not think much of Tostévere. But the tostadas here are piled high with toppings like truffled esquites, shrimp tempura, and grilled octopus. Not in the mood for seafood? Order the short rib sandwich served on flatbread. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Dila\\'s\\n\\n Address: Ancha de San Antonio 35, San Miguel de Allende, Gto., 37700, MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5154 1212Website \\n Dila\\'s combines Sri Lankan food with the owner\\'s Swiss training and Mexican ingredients.

Other favorites include the fish of the day in spicy peanut curry and the sweet, sour, spicy \"devil pork\" ribs. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Mercado Ignacio Ramirez\\n\\n Address: Colegio s/n, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5154 4011Website \\n Eat with the locals at Mercado Ignacio Ramirez, which is joined to San Miguel\\'s artisan market. Order up a quick torta and wash it down with an agua de betabel — sweetened beet juice, a San Miguel staple — or spend hours wandering up and down the stalls. You can even pick up groceries here, if you\\'d like, or small snacks like candies and bags of peanuts to take on your walk. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Café y Churrería San Agustín\\n\\n Address: San Francisco 21, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5154 9102Website \\n Indulge your sweet tooth at this churrería, which fries up foot-long churros around the clock. You may have to hang around in line to get in, but make the trip worth the wait with a piping hot chocolate to pair with your churro. \\n \\n\\nHeading: El Pato Barbacoa y Mixiotes\\n\\n Address: Calz. de la Estación 121, Zona Centro, 37736 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5121 8144Website \\n Under a tarp next to the city\\'s bus terminal, these guys fry up the best barbacoa and mixiotes in town. Don\\'t write off the place too quickly — the barbacoa is tender enough to melt in your mouth, the mixiotes are juicy, and a flan is a must-have dessert. There are a few other street stands around, so look carefully: El Pato has papel picado flags hanging out front. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Jardín Allende and the Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel\\n\\n Address: Principal S/N, Zona Centro, Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., México \\n San Miguel\\'s most popular spots, the main plaza and parish church should be your first stop in town. Grab a snack from a street vendor selling elotes or hot dogs, then head inside the dusty pink \"wedding cake\" church for top-notch brickwork, murals styled after Mexican Modernism, and religious icons around every corner. \\n \\n\\nHeading: La Esquina: Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano\\n\\n Address: Núñez 40, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5152 2602Website \\n Even if you haven\\'t played with toys in years, San Miguel\\'s museum dedicated to all kinds of curios should be on your list. These aren\\'t Barbies and Hot Wheels, but handcrafted Ferris wheels, carefully stitched Frida Kahlos, and beaded alebrijes (small toy animals typically made of woven fabrics). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Biblioteca Pública de San Miguel de Allende\\n\\n Address: Insurgentes #25, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5152 0293Website \\n Pick up a book and sip on a cafecito at the public library\\'s tiny bistro. If your Spanish isn\\'t up to par, not to worry: San Miguel\\'s Biblioteca Pública holds one of the most extensive English-language book collections in all of Latin America. While you\\'re there, peer into the offices of Atención San Miguel, the town\\'s bilingual newspaper, or catch a show from the Teatro Santa Ana on the patio. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Centro Cultural Ignacio Ramírez El Nigromante\\n\\n Address: Calle del Dr Ignacio Hernandez Macias 75, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5152 0289Website \\n San Miguel\\'s reputation as an international artist haven is largely due to this arts school, which housed hordes of the Beat generation back in the day. Now, El Nigromante is a hub of cultural activity, from photography exhibitions to musical performances. If you have the time, check out the institute\\'s sundry arts classes for yourself. \\n \\n\\nHeading: El Mirador\\n\\n Address: Salida Real a Querétaro 92, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., México \\n Perhaps the most popular lookout point in all of San Miguel de Allende, this mirador offers unbeatable views of the centro down below. It\\'s a (somewhat steep) 15-minute walk from downtown. The shops just behind the lookout point are also chock-full of souvenirs and artisan gifts to browse. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Mercado de Artesanías\\n\\n Address: Lucas Balderas S/N, Zona Centro, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoPhone: +52 41 5112 8138 \\n If you\\'re looking to take a piece of Mexico back home, San Miguel\\'s artisan market is a must-stop.

Filled to the brim with decades-old folk art, hammered silver jewelry and hard-to-come-by textile patterns, this vintage store is a dream for serious fans of art from all over Latin America. \\n \\n\\nHeading: La Pulga\\n\\n Address: Salon los Pinos, Salida Real a Querétaro 173, Zona Centro, Valle del Maíz, 37700 San Miguel de Allende, Gto., MéxicoWebsite \\n Treasure hunters will want to hike out to the eastern edge of the city to La Pulga, or the \"Flea Market,\" a monthly free-for-all of second-hand clothes, snacks and new-to-you antiques. Bring cash; most vendors won\\'t accept cards. \\n Michela Buttignol/Trave+Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n El Centro: If you\\'re just in town for a few days, you\\'ll likely spend most of your time here, in San Miguel\\'s historic downtown. The neo-Gothic Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel and its surrounding plaza is a great starting point, but fan out along side streets to explore local boutiques, hole-in-the-wall bars and the city\\'s outdoor markets. \\n Los Balcones: As the name suggests, Los Balcones, or \"the balconies,\" is a hillside neighborhood dotted with homes – and balconies – overlooking downtown. B&Bs and bougainvilles fill the upscale area, along with the stunning Charco Del Ingenio botanical garden. And don\\'t miss a meal at La Mansión de Montitlán, a cash-only fine dining spot that\\'s open for just a few hours each Sunday. Menus rotate weekly, and include options like roasted beet and arugula salad, pan-seared duck breast and hummingbird cake. \\n Guadalupe: If street art\\'s more your style, head to Guadalupe, where cobblestone alleyways and murals mix with vegetarian shops, art galleries and the picturesque Templo de Cristo Rey in the neighborhood\\'s central plaza. For killer vegan food, try out Manipura Restaurante\\'s dishes like encacahuatadas, or enchiladas made with a peanut salsa, or sweet coconut and blueberry tamales for dessert. Across the river, Pulques y Curados La Otomí serves up fermented pulques, a cousin to tequila and mezcal that\\'s flavored with fruits or honey. \\n El Obraje: For a more residential stay, try an Airbnb in El Obraje, just a 10-minute walk north of el centro and close to the Fábrica Aurora art gallery. Plenty of coffee shops are nearby, along with a small colonial chapel and the Parque Municipal Zeferino Gutierrez, a newly opened park that\\'s perfect for morning runs or finishing off the day with an evening light show. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n San Miguel de Allende has a relatively mild climate, with temperatures staying between a certain range year-round. The city is at an altitude—6,234 feet in the air, to be exact—so it can take a few days to get adjusted to the air, and nights can get chilly. And while you may be tempted to head to San Miguel in the summer, that\\'s also rainy season. Showers come down regularly in the afternoons, but never last long enough to keep you inside all day. \\n The following are average Fahrenheit lows and highs by month. \\n January: 45°F to 74°FFebruary: 47°F to 77°FMarch: 52°F to 82°FApril: 56°F to 86°FMay: 60°F to 88°FJune: 61°F to 85°FJuly: 59°F to 81°FAugust: 58°F to 81°FSeptember: 58°F to 80°FOctober: 54°F to 80°FNovember: 50°F to 78°FDecember: 47°F to 75°F \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n San Miguel de Allende: With themed guides, this app walks you across the city, exploring art galleries, cervecerías, and museums around town.iOs | Android \\n mxplor San Miguel de Allende: Forget the clunky headphone sets passed around on audio tours.

              "  'It might sound like a cliché to say a city \"has it all,\" but Santa Fe genuinely fits that description. With thriving arts and culinary scenes, thousands of years of human history, and dozens of miles of hiking trails through canyons, mountains, and forests, it\\'s no surprise that there really is something for everyone. \\n While the activities vary greatly across Santa Fe, the city has an incredibly cohesive feel, thanks to its Pueblo-style exteriors and New Mexican–style interiors that are ubiquitous downtown, in restaurants, galleries, and hotels. \\n There\\'s really no place quite like Santa Fe in the United States, which makes it the perfect destination for your next vacation. Here\\'s everything you need to know to plan an unforgettable trip to Santa Fe. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Time to Visit Santa Fe\\n\\n Santa Fe is a year-round destination; because the city sits at an elevation above 7,000 feet, it experiences all four seasons, despite New Mexico generally having a desert climate. In the summer, you can expect temperatures to reach the high 80s or low 90s, while in the winter, temperatures can fall below freezing. As such, there\\'s a great range of activities in Santa Fe, which travelers can enjoy throughout the year. \\n Mid-summer through early fall is the traditional high season, because the monsoon (typically July and August) brings much-needed rain to this arid region, bringing temperatures down considerably. It also causes the wildflowers to bloom, creating a scenic backdrop to the artsy city. Winter is also a popular time to visit Santa Fe\\'s ski slopes. Spring and mid-to-late fall are shoulder season — you\\'ll find great deals on your stay then, plus milder weather. \\n No matter when you visit, you\\'re likely to experience good weather; Santa Fe has an average of 325 days of sunshine each year. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Things to Do in Santa Fe\\n\\n If there\\'s one thing Santa Fe is known for, it\\'s its arts scene. The city has long been beloved by artists drawn to its landscapes — Georgia O\\'Keeffe was a longtime Santa Fe resident, and there\\'s a museum honoring her life and work here. Today, the city has one of the largest art markets in the country, with more than 250 galleries and dealers selling artwork and artisan-made goods. \\n Besides the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum, there\\'s also the Museum of International Folk Art, the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the New Mexico History Museum, the New Mexico Museum of Art, Museum of Spanish Colonial Art, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, and Meow Wolf, an immersive, interactive art installation that draws an international audience. \\n Santa Fe is also known for its Pueblo-style architecture — everywhere you look downtown, particularly around the Plaza, you\\'ll see structures made of reddish adobe bricks inspired by the buildings of the Pueblo peoples, whose communities you can visit just outside of the city. But there are other architectural gems here, too, including a number of churches and cathedrals, such as St. Francis Cathedral Basilica of Assisi and the Loretto Chapel. \\n And if it\\'s an adventure you seek, the great outdoors is all around Santa Fe. Go hiking in Tent Rocks National Monument, or hit the slopes at Ski Santa Fe. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Hotels in Santa Fe\\n\\n There\\'s no shortage of hotels in Santa Fe, and they range from sprawling luxury resorts to family-run boutique inns. One commonality between all of them? A dedication to Santa Fe–inspired décor, from adobe bricks to colorful textiles. \\n If you\\'re looking to stay downtown near the Plaza, top hotels include the Rosewood Inn of the Anasazi, the Inn of Five Graces, La Fonda on the Plaza, and Inn on the Alameda. You can even stay at a small resort downtown: La Posada de Santa Fe is set on six acres. \\n Looking for a resort just outside of town? Check out the Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe, Ojo Santa Fe Spa Resort, the Hilton Santa Fe Buffalo Thunder, Ten Thousand Waves, and Bishop\\'s Lodge, Auberge Resorts Collection. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Experiencing the Santa Fe Springs\\n\\n Santa Fe is something of an under-the-radar spa destination. Though it might not have the acclaim of Arizona\\'s Sedona, the city is home to world-class spas, some of which are located in downtown hotels, and others of which are part of resorts built around natural hot springs. \\n Sister spa resorts Ojo Santa Fe and Ojo Caliente are located 25 minutes and 60 minutes outside of the city, respectively, and they offer soaking opportunities in spring-fed mineral pools — both hot and cold. Both properties have a range of services beyond soaking, from spa treatments to yoga classes, not to mention accommodations and restaurants. Whereas Ojo Santa Fe has a more lush property filled with greenery, Ojo Caliente offers a more desert-driven experience. \\n If there\\'s one destination spa that could be considered \"off-brand\" for Santa Fe, it\\'s Ten Thousand Waves — but don\\'t let that deter you from a visit. The luxury spa, just a 10-minute drive from downtown, is designed in the style of a Japanese onsen, with private hot tubs and cold plunge pools that visitors can reserve up to 45 days in advance. But Ten Thousand Waves also has spa treatments like facials and massages, as well as the restaurant Izanami and suites for guests who\\'d like to stay overnight. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hiking the Santa Fe Trails\\n\\n Santa Fe is located in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. As such, there are myriad hiking opportunities for people of all athletic abilities. \\n The city of Santa Fe itself operates the Dall Ball Trails, which provide 25 miles of hiking and biking just outside of downtown. Looking for a challenge? Head to the Santa Fe National Forest to tackle the Atalaya Mountain trail, a six-mile, out-and-back hike with an 1,800-foot elevation gain, or the 22.8-mile-long Winsor National Recreation Trail. \\n If you want to add a dose of history and culture into your hike, visit Bandelier National Monument, where 70 miles of trails weave through the ancient lands of 23 Ancestral Pueblo nations. Along the trails, you\\'ll be able to see petroglyphs (ancient drawings) and historic architectural sites. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Ski in Santa Fe\\n\\n When we said Santa Fe is a four-season destination, we meant it. In the winter, Santa Fe transforms into quite the ski destination. Ski Santa Fe is the city\\'s ski resort, located just 16 miles away from downtown in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. There are 86 runs here with a base elevation of 10,350 feet, and they\\'re serviced by seven lifts. Ski Santa Fe has trails for all levels, but overall, this is a family-friendly mountain. Ski season in Santa Fe kicks off in December and runs through mid-March. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Restaurants in Santa Fe\\n\\n New Mexico, as a state, is well-known for its cuisine — a blend of Spanish, Indigenous, Mexican, and American flavors — and you can sample all of it in Santa Fe. Enchiladas, tamales, and posole (a pork stew) are a must, whether you try them at fine-dining establishments or crowd-favorite casual joints. Know that you\\'ll have to pick between green or red chile for many savory dishes in Santa Fe — or you can opt for a \"Christmas\" blend of both, a style reportedly invented at Tia Sophia\\'s Mexican diner, best known for its breakfast burritos. On the sweeter side of the spectrum, be sure to taste local chocolate, biscochitos cookies, and sopaipillas (fried dough often served with honey). \\n It\\'s hard to pick favorite restaurants in Santa Fe, but we\\'ll do our best. For fine dining, we recommend Geronimo and the Compound. For local eats, hit up Tia Sophia\\'s or the Pantry, another diner. And for sweets, head to Dolina Cafe and Bakery or Kakawa Chocolate House. \\n And finally, you must make a stop at the Five & Dime General Store for frito pie — it\\'s a classic! \\n',\n",
              "  'Sardinia\\'s famous Costa Smeralda, a 12-mile stretch of dreamy shoreline along the northeast, attracts travelers looking to immerse themselves in la dolce vita. And really, with its white-sand beaches, turquoise waters, rugged coastline, ancient archaeological sites, and fascinating culture and traditions, who could blame them? The Mediterranean island truly does have it all. \\n Sardinia is the second-largest island in Italy after Sicily and is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. The island spans 9,305 square miles (or slightly larger than the state of Vermont) and is home to about 1.64 million people. The closest land to Sardinia is another island, Corsica, which is only about eight miles north. Sardinia lies 125 miles from the coast of mainland Italy and about the same distance from the shores of Northern Africa. \\n The island — with its idyllic mountains and tranquil villages, giving way to bustling resort towns along its rocky coastline — offers an abundance of activities for every type of traveler. Whether you want to bask in the sun, take in the breathtaking views, or taste the local culture, the island will leave a lasting impression on you. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get to Sardinia\\n\\n Visitors can either fly to one of the three main airports in Sardinia (Cagliari Elmas Airport, Olbia Airport, and Alghero Fertilia Airport) or take a scenic — albeit long — ferry ride to the island. There are multiple daily flights between Italy\\'s major cities and the island, including Rome and Milan, and many of those are operated by low-cost airlines for as cheap as €8. You can also fly to the island from many European cities, including London, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, Brussels, and many more. \\n If time is not of the essence (or you would like to bring a car), take a ferry from mainland Italy, France, or Barcelona. Sardinia has five ferry ports, so you can take the slow route whenever you wish. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Best Times to Go to Sardinia\\n\\n While many consider the Italian island a summer spot, Sardinia offers plenty to do and see year-round. \\n If you are after its sun-drenched picture-perfect beaches, the best time to visit Sardinia is during the peak season between June and September, when temperatures soar. If packed beaches are not your thing, consider stopping by at the end of September or October, when the sea is still warm, but most tourists have left the island. \\n Sardinia is also beautiful in the spring — between March and May — when the flowers and trees are in full bloom, and the weather is perfect for hiking. May is also when the Feast Of Sant\\'efisio Cagliari takes place. It\\'s a multi-day festival, where thousands of participants accompany the statue of Sant\\'efisio from Cagliari to Nora and back, roughly a 40-mile journey. \\n Autunno in Barbagia takes place every fall and lasts a whopping three months. Visitors can enjoy cultural events on weekends dedicated to local arts and crafts. And every winter, the island celebrates Carnival di Mamoiada, one of Sardinia\\'s oldest and most mysterious festivals dating back thousands of years. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do in Sardinia\\n\\n Castello, Cagliari \\n Set on a hill in Sardinia\\'s capital, the historic Castello district is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Cagliari and holds many of the city\\'s significant landmarks.

Two tunnels connect the port to a mine that once allowed workers to quickly load minerals onto the ships. Today, visitors can tour the site only by appointment and with a guide for safety reasons. The hour-long tour includes a walk along the upper tunnel that ends at the terrace, which offers breathtaking views of the sea and coastline. \\n The Neptune\\'s Grotto \\n This two-million-year-old cave in Capo Caccia, Alghero, is one of Sardinia\\'s most-visited natural wonders. Arrival at its entrance is either via boat or a staircase built on the side of a rocky cliff overlooking the sea. Once inside, visitors are introduced to a beautiful world full of wondrous natural sculptures known as stalactites and stalagmites. The grotto is also home to one of the largest saltwater lakes in Europe, Lago Lamarmora. \\n Castelsardo \\n Castelsardo, often ranked as one of Italy\\'s most charming villages, occupies a hill on the northwest of the island. With its landscape dominated by the perfectly preserved medieval Doria castle, colorful houses spilling down the cliff sides, and the glistening waters of the Mediterranean, Castelsardo looks like it\\'s out of a fairy tale. \\n Porto Cervo \\n The crown jewel of Sardinia\\'s renowned Costa Smeralda is this small resort town that, in the summer, becomes the glitzy playground of the international jet set.

              "  'Savannah, Georgia is a city of many faces, both a bona fide necropolis with some of the most haunted places in the U.S. within its limits and a warm and welcoming city with delicious food and joyous outdoor events. Savannah really does have something for everyone. History buffs will love its many tours, conducted by walking, horse-drawn carriages, and by trolley. Foodies will love sampling the best dishes from the many award-winning restaurants and bakeries. Nature-lovers won\\'t want to miss the hiking and stunning vistas on Tybee and Whitemarsh Islands. Music-lovers will be drawn by the many festivals spanning every genre, both indoor and outdoor. And there are few better places to visit if you\\'re interested in paranormal activities — world-renowned Bonaventure Cemetery, the infamous Gribble House, and more are all contained within the most haunted city in America. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Savannah is an amazing place to go to escape winter, as it rarely gets cooler than around 40 degrees and is frequently in the lovely and temperate mid-fifties. And Savannah is an underrated Halloween destination – the city thrives on its history, much of which is a little spooky. Ghost tours of specific haunted places and of the city as a whole are popular year-round but kick it up a notch in late September. If you choose to visit during the summer, know that it gets quite hot and muggy, but the live music and seasonal cuisine makes it entirely worth it. Spring and fall are always lovely times to travel, and moreso when your destination tends toward humidity — Savannah\\'s spring and fall are less muggy, but still warm, and are particularly excellent choices if your goal is to enjoy Savannah\\'s surrounding islands. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Savannah is a decent-sized city, but visitors almost never go beyond the Historic District. It\\'s not that other areas lack for things to do; more that the Historic District has most of the things that Savannah is most famous for, is very walkable, and has the largest concentration of hotels. \\n Savannah really embraces its identity as one of the spookiest cities in America. There\\'s a reason this guide focuses so much on the haunted attractions of the city; there are so many of them, and it is a favorite destination for history buffs, ghost chasers, and anyone who likes a good haunted house tour. There are many other things to do in Savannah, but the city is the subject of one of the most best-selling true crime novels of all time, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt, and has been the subject of some of the most-viewed episodes of beloved ghost hunting shows. \\n In the true spirit of famed Southern hospitality, Savannah locals are warm, friendly, and more than happy to point you toward their favorite places or help you get where you need to go. Sidewalks tend to be wide, allowing the city to be accessible to folks with wheelchairs; it has very few hills, so people with mobility limitations should find Savannah an easy and enjoyable place to visit. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Historic Savannah, where most visitors spend their time, is extremely walkable and it\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll need more than your own two feet to see everything you\\'d like to see. However, if you\\'d like to venture further or faster, here are your best options. \\n Trains: Savannah is not serviced by any local light rails, as the city is on the smaller side. There is an Amtrak station if you want to use Savannah as your base to explore surrounding areas of Georgia. \\n Buses: There are two bus services, the CAT and the DOT. The CAT serves not only Savannah but the surrounding Chatham area, and costs $1.50 per one-way trip. The DOT is completely free, and services 24 stops in the Historic District, including Belles Ferry. The DOT is also ADA-accessible, making it a wonderful service for differently-abled people who want to enjoy all that Savannah has to offer. \\n Taxis: Yellow cab service is available in Savannah, though visitors usually use it mainly to get from the airport to their hotels. Elite Taxi is the company of choice, with the highest ratings and most frequent recommendations. \\n Car service: Uber and Lyft are always good options for transportation. If you are an able-bodied person who enjoys walking, you will likely never need a car to get around Savannah proper. However, if you want to visit the islands around the city or have mobility limitations, ordering a car rarely requires much of a wait. As always, you can order a private car or join a carpool. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: The Marshall House\\n\\n Address: 123 East Broughton Street, Savannah GA 31401Phone: (912) 644-7896Book Now \\n First things first: The Marshall House is one of the most popular hotels in Savannah because it is, allegedly, haunted, and the hotel owners and staff embrace the fun of its reputation.

Most travelers will stick to the Historic Districts, both North and South, as they are the most walkable and feature the vast majority of hot tourist spots. The North district meets the river and contains within its bounds City Market, the Jepson Center, famous River Street, and several of Savannah\\'s many House Museums. The Historic Districts are just that: historic! There\\'s no street to walk down that isn\\'t redolent with Savannah\\'s rich history, and it\\'s easy to spend a full day wandering through the neat, cobbled streets looking at 1800s mansions and parks that predate the United States themselves. \\n Historic District — South: Don\\'t miss the gorgeous fountain in Forsyth Park, or the many House Museums and boutique shops surrounding the park. An easy walk from the river, the Historic District — South starts at Harris St. and extends most of the way down the park. The Andrew Low House (the home of the founder of the Girl Scouts), Flannery O\\'Conner\\'s childhood home, and the infamously haunted Mercer Williams house are all within this district. \\n Victorian District: For any architecture lover, the Victorian District is for you. The 50-block neighborhood is lined with historic and beautifully restored homes that make for a nice relaxing sightseeing stroll. Built as the city\\'s first suburb, the area\\'s architecture mainly dates back to the 1800s. The area abuts Forsyth Park and is just south of the Historic Districts. \\n Thomas Square Streetcar District: Another centrally located neighborhood, just south of the Victorian District, Thomas Square has plenty of history all its own. Designated a National Historic District in 1997, the area is home to over 1,100 historic buildings, making it one of the country\\'s largest such districts. Named after Thomas Square Park in the center of the neighborhood, some people refer to it as \"Metropolitan\" or \"Mid City\" due to its central location. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring in Savannah is pleasant and warm, though rainy — the area averages around 15-20 days of rain in March through May. However, with the city in full bloom, there are fewer more beautiful times to go; the temperature during these months ranges from 50-84°F, so be sure to check the weather before you pack. \\n Summer can be muggy and gets hot, but with that heat comes the southern atmosphere most folks delight in when visiting Georgia and other southern states. With music festivals, events, and outdoor dining galore, Summer is a celebratory time to visit Savannah — just make sure you bring your sunscreen and a water bottle, and an umbrella in case of thunderstorms. Temperatures range from 72-92°F on average. \\n Fall is a pleasant, dry time in Savannah, with temperatures ranging from 50-86°F on average and little rain compared to the rest of the year. Outdoor dining, walking tours, boat rides, and the like should all still be enjoyable. Nights get a bit cooler, so bring layers if you plan to be out and about all day and into the night. \\n Winter is a wonderful time to visit Savannah, especially if your goal is to escape the more brutal temperatures of the northern part of the country. Temperatures stay between a cool 41°F to a comfortable 65°F on average, so you should have no problem enjoying outdoor activities such as walking tours and hiking. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n OpenTable: Restaurant reservations and menu previews.iOs | Android \\n Historic Walking Tour: Self-guided walking tour with customizable routes as well as locals-suggested routesiOs | Android \\n Download the DOT route map \\n',\n",
              "  'With its stately castles, glass-like lochs, and voluptuous glens, Scotland has always been a showstopper. The country\\'s magic extends from its quaint small towns to the snow-capped peaks of its romantic, rugged Highlands to its dynamic modern cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. It\\'s home to some of the best national parks in the U.K. and more than 900 offshore islands with extraordinary wildlife like regal red stags, majestic golden eagles, humpback whales, and massive salmon (not to mention the fabled inhabitant of Loch Ness, too). \\n The raw, poetic beauty of this ancient land — formerly known as Caledonia — is difficult to overstate. If you\\'re hoping to head to the U.K.\\'s ravishing northern nation, read on for our guide to planning the perfect Scotland vacation. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Times to Go to Scotland\\n\\n The bad news is that, like the rest of the U.K., Scotland\\'s weather is far from reliable, even at the height of summer. But as long as you\\'re prepared to accept that and pack a raincoat for the odd shower or two, then you\\'ll be fine from May to September. The smart money is on visiting in June and the first two weeks of July, when Scotland basks in seemingly endless summer evenings (the sun doesn\\'t set until 11 p.m. in some parts of the Highlands) and the British school holidays have not yet begun, so prices remain low. \\n For winter travelers, Scotland has the U.K.\\'s best ski resort at Cairngorm Mountain, while the capital, Edinburgh, hosts one of the world\\'s biggest New Year\\'s Eve parties, Hogmanay. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do in Scotland\\n\\n If you like the great outdoors, you\\'ll love Scotland. It\\'s an ideal place for hiking, biking, and generally embracing the wildly beautiful landscape. You can summit magnificent Ben Nevis in a day (the tallest mountain in the U.K., at 4,413 feet), take a ferry out to explore the Hebrides archipelago and its stunning white-sand beaches, tour scores of castles, including the Queen\\'s favorite holiday home, Balmoral (open to the public every April through July), and dive into a quirky food scene encompassing dishes like haggis (an offal and oatmeal combo, which tastes significantly better than it sounds), deep-fried mars bars, and juicy scallops, langoustines, and mussels. \\n Scotland is also a mecca for both golfers (St. Andrews Old Course is the headline act) and whisky lovers, with some of the world\\'s best distilleries available to tour, including Johnnie Walker on Edinburgh\\'s lively Princes Street, Glenlivet near pretty Ballindalloch, and the legendary Macallan on a sprawling country estate in nearby Aberlour. \\n If you enjoy driving, you\\'ll find some of the U.K.\\'s emptiest, most dramatic roads here, too, (as driven by James Bond in \"Skyfall\"), including the latest official addition, the North Coast 500, an action-packed 500-mile route (516 to be exact) featuring mind-boggling coastal scenery, jaw-dropping beaches, rolling hillside, quaint fishing villages, and multiple hidden gems. \\n And if you prefer your challenges on foot, check out the magnificent West Highland Way, the country\\'s best-loved long-distance walking route. Snaking its way from Milngavie to Fort William, it covers some of Scotland\\'s finest scenery over 96 miles and is normally completed from south to north. \\n Meanwhile, history buffs will also be agog on any visit to Scotland, thanks to its 3,000-plus castles (Castle Sween in Argyll is the oldest, dating back to the 1100s), as well as plenty to check out in the winding wynds (narrow lanes) and twisted staircases of Edinburgh\\'s enchanting Old Town. (Edinburgh Castle, towering over the city, is arguably the grandest in the country, too.) \\n If you can, make time to visit Perth, the former Scottish capital where kings were crowned on the Stone of Destiny and infamous Glen Coe, a beautiful valley full of waterfalls and deer, also known for the brutal clan massacre of 1692 (which inspired the Red Wedding in George R. R. Martin\\'s Game of Thrones). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where are the Scottish Highlands — and what is the best way to get there?\\n\\n Jess Macdonald/Travel + Leisure \\n The clue is in its name: the Highlands are the mountainous upper half of Scotland, covering 10,000 square miles of picturesque scenery. The region\\'s lively capital is Inverness, which sits centrally and is a superb base from which to explore, while other highlights include mysterious, misty Loch Ness, majestic Cairngorms National Park, and idyllic Isle of Skye, which has been connected to the mainland via a road bridge since 1995. \\n The easiest way to reach the Highlands is to fly into Inverness Airport from London or elsewhere in the U.K., or rent a car and drive from Glasgow or Edinburgh. However, the way to arrive in style is on the Caledonian Sleeper train from London Euston, a chugging time machine where you can fall asleep to the sounds of black cabs and bustle of the British capital and wake up among the red deer and magical glens of the Highlands. Regularly nominated as one of the world\\'s best train journeys, the scenery gets truly spectacular after Fort William, as the route skirts a dramatic chain of lochs before descending into lush glens and crossing the Glenfinnan Viaduct made famous by the Harry Potter films. For the ultimate Hogwarts experience, steam locomotives work this route during the summer months, so check in advance for these special departures. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay in Scotland\\n\\n The major cities have an abundance of hotels for every budget, headlined by Glasgow\\'s Kimpton Blythswood Square, a boutique property in the former headquarters of the Royal Scottish Automobile Club, and The Dunstane Houses in Edinburgh, a pair of beautifully renovated 19th-century townhouses. \\n Scotland arguably does traditional country house hotels and rustic lodges better than anywhere else in the world, with Fife Arms in Braemar and Gleneagles in Perthshire being particular treats (the latter, nicknamed the \"Glorious Playground\" boasts three championship golf courses, its own dedicated train station, and the only restaurant in the country with two Michelin stars). \\n Scotland is, of course, peppered with castles, and many have been converted into hotels and B&Bs in recent years, with some of the better fortified accommodation options including Glenapp Castle in Ayrshire, Inverlochy Castle in Fort William, Atholl Palace Hotel in Pitlochry, and Stonefield Castle Hotel on Loch Fyne. \\n Wherever you stay, you\\'ll get a warm welcome — not to mention a hot bowl of Scottish porridge or a plate of bacon, eggs, and haggis to start the day in a spectacularly scenic country. \\n',\n",
              "  'The Pacific Northwest is known for its unadulterated natural beauty — from picturesque waterfronts to mountains beyond the city — and truly excellent coffee. And Seattle, as a hub of the PNW, is a perfect gateway to the area. Seattle feels simultaneously like a buzzing city and an outdoor lover\\'s paradise. Lined by the Puget Sound, Lake Union, and Lake Washington, it\\'s also home to some of the best seafood in the country, which is part of the reason why its food scene is so revered. Beyond the terrific restaurants, Seattle is known for its long and storied music history — it\\'s the land of Jimi Hendrix, The Postal Service, Nirvana, Macklemore, Foo Fighters, and Pearl Jam, among others. \\n As for Seattle\\'s tourist attractions, you\\'ll spend your days taking the monorail between sites like Pike Place Market, Olympic Sculpture Park, and the Space Needle. From strolling Pike Place Market at lunch, to curling up with a book at a local coffee shop on a rainy afternoon, to hitting the music clubs in Belltown, you\\'ll spend a few days in Seattle and quickly find you\\'ll never want to leave. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The best time to visit Seattle is from June to October. Seattle sees a lot of rain, but June, July, and August are the driest months. And with the breeze coming off the Puget Sound, the summers aren\\'t too hot. It starts to cool down in September and October, but the fall in Seattle is crisp and inviting, especially as the abundant trees change color. \\n As for events to keep on your radar, April is a big month for Seattle because it brings both the Seattle Cherry Blossom Festival and the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. Beyond the flower shows, the Seattle International Film Festival is in June, the Seattle International Beerfest is in July, and the Seattle Marathon is in November. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Seattle Center is one of the most important tourist attractions in the city. It spans 74 acres and was once the site of the 1962 World\\'s Fair. Within Seattle Center, you\\'ll find the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden and Glass, among other attractions. \\n The Seattle monorail is a scenic, above-ground train that runs from Seattle Center to Westlake Center, which lies three blocks from Pike Place Market. A monorail ride costs $3 and is a great way to get around when you\\'re sightseeing in the city. \\n Seattle is a tech capital of America, home to the headquarters of Amazon, IMDB, and Zillow, among other influential companies. \\n The city is also an important music hub, where you can always catch up-and-coming bands at clubs in Belltown. Plenty of A-list musical talent has come out of the Seattle area, from Jimi Hendrix to Death Cab for Cutie. \\n Seattle\\'s Pike Place Market is one of the oldest-operating farmers\\' markets in America. It opened in 1907. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: King County Metro has four different railway options: the Link light rail, Seattle Center Monorail, Seattle streetcar, and the Sounder train. The Link runs through downtown Seattle all the way to Sea-Tac Airport. Meanwhile, the Seattle streetcar has three different lines operating throughout the city. The Sounder train is a commuter rail that brings passengers outside the city limits. And finally, the monorail, which costs $3 for adults and $1.50 for kids, runs from the Space Needle at Seattle Center to Westlake Center, located just three blocks from Pike Place Market. \\n Buses: King County Metro offers more than 200 buses to take you around Seattle and the surrounding areas. Find a list of bus lines and their schedules here. You can pay for the bus with an ORCA card or with the exact fare in cash. (It\\'s worth noting that bus drivers will not be able to offer you change.) Bus rides cost $2.50.Car Service and Taxis: Uber and Lyft both service Seattle. You can also find a taxi easily at the airport or select stands around the city, but it\\'s easier to schedule one through a service like Seattle Yellow Cab. For a black car service, try local companies like Seattle Royal Town Car. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: 110 Stewart St., Seattle, WA 98101Phone: (206) 623-4600Book Now \\n Located right near Pike Place Market, Thompson Seattle has lavish modern decor, a fantastic cocktail program at its rooftop lounge, Nest, and rooms and suites with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the Puget Sound.

              "  'For supercharged adventures in the desert Southwest, Sedona — the crown jewel of the Verde Valley — offers everything from spirituality-boosting energy vortexes to an unexpected wine country to world-class hiking among the area\\'s signature red rock landscape. Given such ancient assets, it\\'s important to note that if you\\'re among the 3 million visitors annually, you should consider these three things: support small, locally owned businesses, adopt the city\\'s Leave No Trace principles, and commune calmly with your surroundings. Keep reading to see what else you should do, see, and where you should stay in Sedona, Arizona. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do in Sedona\\n\\n Sedona\\'s vortex phenomenon makes it a popular place for those looking to do a bit of spiritual intention setting. But, even if you skip a desert meditation, you\\'re still guaranteed transcendent views when you visit these remarkable Red Rock destinations. Popular vortex hiking destinations include Airport Mesa for city vistas and Cathedral Rock\\'s virtually vertical but mercifully brief ascent. But like many of Sedona\\'s popular paths, these unique spots are environmentally fragile and can often be overcrowded. For a hike without the crowds, consider taking a jaunt on one of the Secret 7 trails. The Aerie Trail, for example, is a moderately difficult excursion with lots of morning shade and panoramic views of the Secret Mountain Wilderness. \\n A more straightforward spiritual setting is the Chapel of the Holy Cross (also an official vortex site), a beautiful example of religious architecture from 1956 by a Frank Lloyd Wright pupil whose modernist design features a 90-foot-tall cross symbolically anchored into the earth. \\n Four-wheel driving over and around the buttes — named for their distinct shapes, like Bell Rock, Coffee Pot Rock, or Snoopy Rock — is best left to the pros. And that\\'s precisely why you should book a trip with the drivers of the jacked-up Jeep Wranglers at Pink Adventure Tours. Sign up for the two-hour, nail-biting Broken Arrow ride to Submarine Rock and Chicken Point, a traverse of rocky roads and steep, dusty descents that may undo any chiropractic progress you\\'ve been making, albeit for a worthwhile memory. \\n Don\\'t sweat the summertime in the cool pools at Slide Rock State Park, whose 80-foot-long water-carved sandstone chute gets its titular slip from algae. (Note: water shoes are an excellent choice here.)To see Indigenous ruins up close with bonus narration from a live docent, head to the reservations-only Palatki Heritage Site, where you\\'ll explore cliff dwellings, ceremonial sites, and an outdoor natural museum\\'s worth of pictographs from the Sinagua people and other archaic cultures dating back 3,000 to 6,000 years. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sedona Hotels\\n\\n Sedona\\'s smaller, locally owned accommodations evoke the location\\'s funky vibe with delightful sincerity. The Red Agave Resort adjoins US Forest Service land, meaning the close-range views of Bell Rock and Courthouse Butte are unobstructed. The property has a private trailhead that points toward a bundle of different walking paths, from the Slim Shady Trail to the Bell Rock Pathway. Each of the resort\\'s A-frame loft chalets sleeps five people and has a full kitchen. (The kitchen comes in handy after picking up local provisions at the Sunday morning Sedona Community Farmers Market.) \\n The Star Motel in Uptown Sedona makes the most of its original cinder block confines with a mix of mid-century furnishings like colorful Eames-inspired shell chairs alongside vintage Indigenous art and objects, from Indian blankets to ceremonial bows to painted portraits of native chiefs. The lodge is named for the clear view of the galaxies above Sedona, one of only 20 official Dark Sky communities in the nation. Bonus tip: Nearby the motel is one of the city\\'s best stargazing observation points, the open field at the Jordan Road Trailhead. \\n There are several luxury properties scattered across Sedona for those looking for a splurge-worthy experience. Enchantment Resort offers guided hiking and mountain biking excursions alongside spa services ranging from classic massages to body treatments like the Prickly Pear Butter Wrap, which includes a body scrub, shower, and hydrating body butter. \\n Then there\\'s the famed L\\'Auberge de Sedona, which specializes in immersive experiences and retreats, including daily activities like Introduction to Crystals and Meditation. \\n High-end hotel fans shouldn\\'t look past Amara, a hotel that maintains its rustic charm thanks to its rough edge exterior but still comes with plenty of luxury offerings inside like a full-service spa, oversized suites, and a glittering infinity-edge pool overlooking the verdant landscape. \\n Skyranch Lodge is also notable for its location as it sits 500 feet above the town fray on a beautifully landscaped section. The resort grounds are an accredited botanical garden of rare and native plants of Airport Mesa. Spring for the Rim View rooms or Cottage Suites for lavish furnishings like four-poster beds and fireplaces, plus panoramic views from the private balconies. While others have to drive to Airport Mesa at sunset, all you need to do is take a leisurely 20-minute stroll from the Lodge via the picturesque Sedona View Trail to hit the vortex in time to bid farewell to the day. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sedona Restaurants\\n\\n The most coveted table in Sedona is at the award-winning Elote Cafe. The restaurant specializes in traditional Southwestern and Mexican cuisine, expertise gained from chef-owner Jeff Smedstad\\'s Arizona upbringing and extensive travels south of the border. Signature dishes include the elote (fire-roasted corn with spicy mayo, lime, and cotija cheese) and an exceptionally succulent lamb adobo (a long-braised Superior Farms shank in ancho-chile sauce). The restaurant\\'s tequila program is also second to none in Sedona, featuring small heritage productions like the Camarena family\\'s G4 and private barrels from Cascahuín. \\n Other gastronome-approved eating experiences in Greater Sedona include an utterly pleasant creekside picnic of cold-smoked salmon rillettes and truffled roast vegetables paired with sustainable wine at Page Springs Cellars in nearby Cornville.The Osteria at Cottonwood\\'s Merkin Vineyards (owned by Maynard James Keenan, gentleman winemaker and frontman for the dark-metal band Tool) serves scratch-made Italian food like airy potato gnocchi in sage-and-prosciutto cream sauce. For fusion fare, try the chicken relleno \"lasagna cupcakes,\" layered with duck-egg pasta sheets, roast chicken, and poblano chiles from the Merkin gardens. \\n On a more casual note, the Cowboy Club in uptown Sedona may be a destination of Western kitsch, but its frontier food is anything but. Don\\'t miss the spoon-tender bison pot roast in succulent pan sauce or the thick elk chops with a slick of savory demi-glace.End the day at the old-fashioned ice cream shop, the Black Cow Cafe, where fresh-baked pie and cookies scent the air. Get a scoop like the high-desert favorite prickly pear or snag a cone filled with classic butter pecan, churned in-house. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time of Year to Visit\\n\\n If you\\'re seeking quiet, peaceful trails, then be prepared to traverse those tracks slathered in sunscreen. Believe it or not, the height of summer — when temperatures soar into the 90s — is a great time to visit. After all, Sedona is considered a \"cool\" getaway for those living in cities like Scottsdale and Phoenix, where triple digits are par for the summer. \\n Bookend your days with shorter walks in the early morning and early evening (Sedona\\'s longest light is in July when the sun rises around 5:15 am and sets around 7:40 pm). Stellar spots to do just that include Fay Canyon (2.4 miles round trip) or Bell Rock (1.75 miles round trip). While the sun is high, head for the cool shaded courtyards and air-conditioned art galleries of Tlaquepaque Village. Step into Mountain Trails Gallery, which features western art by local painters and sculptors, and Rowe Fine Art, where owner Ken Rowe sculpts highly detailed wildlife forms in bronze. \\n Another option is to time your visit to any of Sedona\\'s popular festivals throughout the year. The WineFest takes place in late September, celebrating the harvest of the Verde Valley. Seek out something shiny at October\\'s annual Sedona Rock, Gem, and Jewelry Show. Since collecting rocks and other natural treasures from national- and state-park land is illegal, you can search for rare gemstones, crystals, and fossils from dozens of vetted vendors at the highly anticipated annual event. \\n',\n",
              "  'When you think of China, there are many things that come to mind: an ancient culture full of beauty and history, very large cities with towering skyscrapers, and incredible food from the street vendors up to high-end restaurants. Shanghai blends all of that into one thriving city. \\n Shanghai, which sits on the Yangtze River, is one of the most populated cities in the world and the most populated city in China. In a country known for its mega cities, Shanghai easily takes the crown. \\n Often called the Paris of the East, Shanghai is a mix of modern towers that define its skyline, like the Oriental Pearl TV Tower with its iconic circular design, and quaint neighborhoods that make visitors feel like they\\'ve been transported to the romantic streets of Europe. \\n From classic xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) to Michelin star meals, top-floor observation towers to an after-dinner stroll along the Bund waterfront, Shanghai offers something for everyone. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n China Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n One of the coolest times to visit Shanghai is around Chinese New Year, which tends to fall around late January or February.

              "  'The Blue Ridge Mountains region is a 600-mile-long segment of the mighty Appalachian range. Like all Appalachians, these rock formations are far older than the Rockies, their counterpart to the west. While the Rockies are sharp and sheer, the Blue Ridge Mountains are rounded and relatively low, with more than a billion years of wind, rain, and snow behind them. They\\'re famous for their bluish haze, which can appear deep ocean blue, pale purple, or somewhere in between. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where Are the Blue Ridge Mountains?\\n\\n Most definitions agree that the range stretches more than 600 miles from Georgia\\'s Mount Oglethorpe to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Between those two points, the ridge spans South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, and some maps include West Virginia and even Alabama and Kentucky. Yet its cultural heart and the bulk of its mass belong to North Carolina and Virginia. \\n The range is predominantly associated with the western parts of North Carolina and Virginia, so we\\'ll focus on those two states in this guide to all things Blue Ridge, which includes when to go, where to hike, and more. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Times to Go to the Blue Ridge Mountains\\n\\n Nature lovers will find year-round nirvana in the Blue Ridge Mountains, though spring, summer, and fall are the best times of year to visit for exuberant flora, pleasant weather, and an array of outdoor activities. \\n During the spring, the region bursts with green buds and wildflowers. Animals emerge and spring rains feed gushing streams and waterfalls. By April, most river tours have kicked off whitewater-rafting season (typically through September). Wildflower hikes and spring festivals are among the top things to do. \\n Temperatures climb in the summer, yet the elevation keeps humidity at bay. And spring\\'s to-do checklist (camping, kayaking, fly-fishing, biking) grows even bigger, with swimming and local events like music festivals, farmers markets, and craft fairs. \\n In the fall, fiery colors blaze across the Blue Ridge. This is perhaps the most popular time of year to visit, as leaf-peepers pour in to see the region\\'s famously beautiful fall foliage. \\n Many attractions shut down in the winter, though skiing and holiday festivities enter the equation. You can find several family-friendly ski resorts with relatively easy terrain, including North Carolina\\'s Sugar and Beech mountains and Virginia\\'s Wintergreen resort. The region takes on a magical appearance around Christmas, with small-town celebrations, holiday light displays at Asheville\\'s Biltmore Estate, and Christmas train rides like the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway in Georgia and thePolar Express in North Carolina. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Hike in the Blue Ridge Mountains\\n\\n There\\'s perhaps no better way to feel the life force of the Blue Ridge Mountains than to set out on one of its hiking trails. There are hundreds to choose from, many located off or near the popular Blue Ridge Parkway. (The long-distance Appalachian and Mountains-to-Sea trails both shadow sections of this famous drive.) \\n One such region, Virginia\\'s Roanake Valley, has some of the most sought-after hiking spots in the U.S., including McAfee Knob (thought to be the most photographed site on the Appalachian Trail), panoramic Sharp Top andTinker Cliffs, and rocky Devil\\'s Marbleyard. \\n The north end the Blue Ridge Parkway brings you just near the waterfalls, wildflowers, and woodlands of Shenandoah National Park. Here, 500 miles of hiking trails crisscross 200,000 acres of protected land; the most popular route is Old Rag Circuit, a 9.4-mile loop that features rock scrambling and panoramic views from the summit. \\n Down closer to the North Carolina-Virginia border, you\\'ll find Grayson Highlands State Park about an hour west of the Blue Ridge Parkway. This 4,500-acre park is often compared to the Scottish Highlands for its open meadows, mossy-floored spruce forests, mountain balds, and rocky ridgelines. You might even spot a wild pony grazing near a trail. \\n Part of the Appalachian Trail, the shrubby Roan Highlands section is a string of five separate summits. In the summer, this high-elevation area along the North Carolina-Tennessee border is full of rhododendrons, azaleas, and other wildflowers. (Tip: Don\\'t even think about hiking here without a brimmed hat.) Like Grayson Highlands, this is worth a detour off the Blue Ridge Parkway. \\n Scooting south, you\\'ll get to North Carolina\\'s Linville Falls (within \\u200b\\u200bLinville Gorge Wilderness). It\\'s the waterfall to see on the Blue Ridge Parkway, with three trails leading to the plunge from different viewpoints. Further down by milepost 408, you can access the Summit Trail of Mount Pisgah, which travels through oak forest to the scrubby peak. There\\'s also the 16-mile Shut-In Trail, part of a route originally used by industrialist George Vanderbilt for hunting retreats (now part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail). \\n And, of course, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where the Blue Ridge Parkway ends (or begins, for northbound travelers), is rich with hiking options for all levels. The UNESCO-listed national park has 850 miles of trails; two favorites (both on the hard end of the spectrum) include Chimney Tops and Alum Cave trails. The easy-ratedLaurel Falls Trail (blooming with the namesake mountain laurel each May) takes hikers to an 80-foot waterfall. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do in the Blue Ridge Mountains\\n\\n The Blue Ridge region provides an astonishing abundance of activities beyond hiking, too. \\n In the hotter months, there\\'s nothing like cooling off in crisp, clear mountain water. Sliding Rock in North Carolina\\'s Pisgah National Forest is a special summer favorite. Here, visitors line up to take their turn zipping down the natural 60-foot stone \"sliding board\" before plunging into the icy pool at the bottom. \\n Cool, clear mountain streams and lakes offer ample opportunities to reel in a fish as well. Fly-fishing fans will find mountain creeks, streams, and rivers teeming with trout (brook, brown, and rainbow), while those who prefer fishing the still waters of lakes and ponds might snag a largemouth bass, whitefish, or catfish. \\n One of the best ways to experience the surrounding mountain scenery is from the water. If you\\'re cruising the Blue Ridge Parkway, pristine Price Lake (milepost 296.7) is a great pullover spot with boat and canoe rentals. The fast-moving currents of the French Broad River outside Asheville attract experienced paddlers and rafting tour groups. And the popular Deep Creek recreation area near Bryson City, North Carolina, features two tubing runs for both wild and leisurely rides. \\n One of the best biking trails in the country is found in a rural Blue Ridge corner of Virginia. The Virginia Creeper Trail is a former Native American footpath (once used by Daniel Boone) and early 1900s rail line whose steam engine trains once delivered lumber to thriving Virginia and North Carolina sawmills. The railroad corridor-turned-recreation trail rolls through farmland and mountain scenery, with a gentle grade for cyclists (and walkers, joggers, and horseback riders) of all levels. \\n Creek crossings, moonlit rides, and backcountry jaunts — you can find trail rides for all ages and experience levels throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains. \\n Just hitting the road in this part of the world is an unforgettable experience. There\\'s the Blue Ridge Parkway, of course, as well as Shenandoah\\'s famousSkyline Drive and the 42-mileCherohala Skyway, a sports car and motorcycle magnet split between the high-altitude ridges of North Carolina and Tennessee. One stretch of U.S. 129, dubbed Tail of the Dragon, packs 318 curves into 11 miles. New River Valley Byway follows an old trail stamped out by buffalo, winding through Christmas farm country. \\n If mountain peaks and dizzying viewpoints still aren\\'t high enough, you can go even further with an early morning hot-air balloon ride. Seeing Blue Ridge scenery from the sky is truly unparalleled. \\n The beauty of the Blue Ridge come fall — when the mountains are gleaming with turning leaves — indelibly impacts those who witness it. Colors first begin to change in the higher, cooler elevations around late September and early October, followed the lower elevations into November. The stunning display of vivid reds, oranges, and yellows makes October the busiest month on the Blue Ridge Parkway. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay in the Blue Ridge Mountains\\n\\n What Vanderbilt described as his \"little mountain escape\" is, in fact, a 250-room château and the largest private home in the U.S. The Biltmore and its 8,000 surrounding acres form one of the top attractions in the region. Tour its over-the-top rooms (see how many of the mansion\\'s 65 fireplaces you can count) and Frederick Law Olmsted-designed gardens and grounds, which include a historic farm, on-site winery, 20 miles of bike and nature trails, and more. \\n History, culture, and natural beauty collide in Asheville, one of the most popular mountain home bases in the Blue Ridge. The well-loved Windsor Boutique Hotel puts guests in the center of Asheville\\'s brewpub/vintage shop/indie restaurant heart. The famous Biltmore Estate, meanwhile, offers three lodging options — a wallet-friendly hotel, a high-end inn, and luxury cottages — all immensely popular. The views, spa, and fireplace-framed Great Hall of the 1913 Grove Park Inn (an Omni hotel) inspire reverence among travelers. \\n Yet many want to rent a cabin or pitch a tent. Perfectly located between Asheville, Biltmore, and the Blue Ridge Parkway, Mountain Springs Cabins lets you relax on your porch swing and grill out at night amid a sea of fireflies. \\n A UNESCO World Heritage site, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is famous for its natural beauty, extensive wildlife, and 850 miles of hiking trails. Nearby accommodations include cabin rentals, campgrounds (sites at in-park Cades Cove, Smokemont, and Balsam Mountain are in high demand), chain hotels, and rustic mountain retreats (like the Lodge at Tellico andLeConte Lodge). In a crook of the Cheoah River, River\\'s Edge Treehouse Resort is a summer-camp-like collection of cabins between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the pristine Nantahala National Forest. \\n The small North Carolina town of Bryson City makes a great home base for Great Smoky and Blue Ridge exploration. Bordering Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the banks of the Tuckasegee River, the scenic town has a great local scene that includes lovely places to stay like the charming Folkestone Inn, the boutique Everett Hotel (right on the historic town square), the group-friendly Calhoun House Inn & Suites, and the immersed-in-nature Lakeview at Fontana Inn & Treetop Soaking Cabanas. \\n This beautiful corner of North Carolina near the South Carolina-Georgia border is famous for its waterfall-heavy scenery — Dry Falls, Glen Falls, Cullasaja River Gorge, Bridal Veil Falls, Secret Falls, and Whitewater Falls, the highest waterfall east of the Rockies, are all worth a trip. A destination known for its natural beauty, the area has built an impressive tally of boutique hotels and lodges, including the reimagined motor courts of Hotel Cashiers and Skyline Lodge, as well as Fire Mountain, a mountaintop inn with cabins and tree houses. \\n There are five seasonal campgrounds within the park boundaries, all amid picturesque mountains and pristine fishing streams. Big Meadows Campground is a good pick for first-timers, as it\\'s near Harry F. Byrd, Sr. Visitor Center and the popular Dark Hollow Falls Trail, while Loft Mountain Campground at the top of Big Flat Mountain offers incredible sunrise and sunset views. Skyland Resort sits on the highest point of Skyline Drive, the gasp-inducing road that winds more than 100 miles through the park along the main mountain ridge. \\n',\n",
              "  'St. Barts—also known as St-Barth, St. Barths, and Saint Barthélemy—is a French-speaking Caribbean island known for its luxe vibe and flawless beaches. Popular among the jet set, St. Barts is home to many high-end restaurants, designer stores, and yachts, but not a lot of land or people: the population of the 9.26-square-mile island was around 10,000 in the most recent census. \\n With no direct flights from the U.S., this little piece of paradise in the French West Indies isn\\'t super easy to reach, but that\\'s part of its allure. Many visitors arrive by private plane or yacht, and those who go the commercial route know the treasure awaiting them at the end is worth the multi-step journey. \\n Arrive to the hilly, red-roofed island—after a thrilling touchdown on a short beachfront airstrip; landing here is one of the most remarkable airport experiences in the world—and you\\'ll instantly see what makes St. Barts such a coveted getaway. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Atlantic Standard Time all year (no clock changes during Daylight Saving Time) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The weather is warm year-round, so weather isn\\'t the main factor to consider for a visit—but there are other types of seasons to contend with in St. Barts. \\n Late November through early January is peak tourist season. Prices on hotels and flights are much higher than usual, and some properties even require two-week minimum stays around the holidays. High season lasts through February, but the prices aren\\'t quite as high as they are around the holidays. \\n March and April continue to see higher rates due to events like Easter, spring break, and various regattas, including the annual St. Barths Bucket Regatta that takes place each March. May and June are great months to visit St. Barts because there are still many visitors, but the crowds are thinner and the rates aren\\'t quite so inflated. It\\'s also outside of hurricane season, which begins in June. \\n June through November is hurricane season and while the rates are much lower during the summer, there is a risk that your plans will be affected by the development of a storm. If you\\'re not worried about this, it can be a great time to visit and experience a slightly more affordable, less crowded St. Barts. \\n Note that some properties close for seasonal maintenance during September and October. Late summer also tends to be rainier in St. Barts, while November through April is the island\\'s drier season. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro (Check the current exchange rate) \\n Official Language: French (but everyone speaks English) \\n Calling Code: +590 \\n Capital City: Gustavia \\n Power Outlets: The European-style sockets have two round holes, so bring an adapter plug if needed. \\n There are no direct flights from the U.S. to St. Barts (unless you\\'re chartering a private plane). Your options to get to St. Barts include flying into San Juan, Puerto Rico, and taking a one-hour flight aboard Tradewind Aviation, which can be pricey; flying into the island of St. Maarten and taking a 15-minute flight aboard St Barths Commuter or WinAir, which tends to be more affordable but also requires clearing customs in St. Maarten; or flying into the island of St. Maarten and taking a 45-minute ferry to St. Barts. \\n Renting a car on the island is the way to go—cabs are hard to come by and very expensive. Fortunately, navigating the island by car is a breeze, and it\\'s one of the more budget-friendly activities on the island. \\n Renting a villa is a popular alternative to staying in a hotel in St. Barts. A villa may be a better option if you\\'re traveling with a group or desire more privacy than a hotel affords. Small cottages and apartment-style condos can also be a more affordable alternative to hotels; you\\'ll also save money on food by cooking some of your own instead of eating out for every meal. \\n Expect some seasonal closures during the Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June to November. (However, this is also a good time to score significantly lower rates, as long as you\\'re aware your plans may be forced to change due to the weather.) \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n St. Barts has no public transportation or bus system. Instead, most travelers rent a car, motorbike, scooter, or bicycles. Taxis are available on the island, but are very limited in number and extremely pricey. The island is small, and getting around the entire thing takes less than half an hour. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Le Sereno\\n\\n Address: Grand Cul de Sac BP 19Phone: +590 590 29 83 00Website \\n Home to one of the most iconic pools on the island, Le Sereno reopens October 2021 following a complete rebuild after Hurricane Irma.

The glamorous digs are a magnet for royalty and Hollywood A-listers, and the location in St Jean Bay offers breathtaking views. Each of the rooms, suites, and villas is uniquely decorated, so no two stays are the same. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Le Barthélemy Hotel & Spa\\n\\n Address: Baie de Grand Cul de Sac, Saint-Barthélemy 97133, St. BarthélemyPhone: +590 590 77 48 48Website \\n Le Barthélemy is located on Grand Cul-De-Sac Beach, but the hotel\\'s pool and various other forms of pampering nearly rival the natural wonder. With dining options, a spa, and beautiful rooms and villas, Le Barthélemy offers a full resort experience in one chic package. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Across St. Barts, reservations are highly recommended during high season; during off-peak months, you should be able to get a table at most places without a reservation, but it doesn\\'t hurt to make one anyway. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Nikki Beach\\n\\n Address: Baie de Saint Jean, 97133 St. Barth, FWIPhone: +590 590 27 64 64Website \\n A party hotspot, Nikki Beach is the place to see and be seen in St. Barts, especially during weekend brunches.

Expect a festive atmosphere and French-Caribbean flavors. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Orega\\n\\n Address: 13 Rue Samuel Fahlberg, Gustavia 97133, St. BarthélemyPhone: +590 590 52 45 31Website \\n You\\'ll want to make a reservation at Orega, because the intimate atmosphere and mind-blowing flavors found at this French-Japanese fusion restaurant are in high demand.

Enjoy a beautiful view of the port as you dine on fresh, chef-created dishes that rival your picture-perfect surroundings. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Le Tamarin\\n\\n Address: Saline Saint-Barthélemy BL 97133, St. BarthélemyPhone: +590 590 29 27 74Website \\n If you\\'re seeking a more casual-feeling restaurant that still maintains the ultra-chic vibe of St. Barts, opt for something different at Le Tamarin. Instead of a sea of blues, the view from most of the best restaurants in St. Barts, at this French spot you\\'ll treat your eyes to a sea of lush greens. The intimate garden atmosphere is the perfect palate cleanser after indulging in nonstop beaches. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Maya\\'s To Go\\n\\n Address: Les Galeries du Commerce, St. Jean, Saint BarthelemyPhone: +590 590 29 83 70Website \\n If you\\'re looking for light and healthy, you\\'ll find it at Maya\\'s To Go. The flavorful dishes are created from Caribbean-sourced ingredients, and it\\'s the perfect spot to pick up sandwiches and salads for a beach picnic, or stay and enjoy dining on the open-air patio. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Enjoy the beaches\\n\\n The island has a lot to love, but the beaches are its main attraction. Pick your poison: Saline is gorgeous, secluded, and simple, with no bars or restaurants to disturb the quiet vibe; St. Jean Beach provides the total opposite experience, as it\\'s home to Eden Rock and Nikki Beach, so there\\'s lots of action and great people-watching; Shell Beach is so named because it\\'s covered in crushed shells (it\\'s also home to the popular beach bar/restaurant Shellona, so no need to pack your own lunch); and Gouverneur is an unspoiled cove that\\'s great for picnics and privacy. Visit one or all of them and you\\'re guaranteed the beach day of your dreams. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Do the Colombier hike\\n\\n Though the Colombier hike leads to a private beach only accessible by foot or by yacht, it remains one of the must-do activities in St. Barts. If you don\\'t want to brave the hike, consider chartering a boat that will take you to Colombier to snorkel. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Watch the sunset at Hotel Christopher\\n\\n Address: Pointe Milou F-97133, St Barthélemy, F.W.IPhone: +590 590 27 63 63Website \\n Perhaps the best place to watch the sunset in St. Barts is from Hotel Christopher\\'s infinity pool overlooking the ocean. Even non-guests are permitted to come for drinks and enjoy the view. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Hike and swim at the Grand Fond natural pool\\n\\n Take a short hike to the beautiful natural pool of Grand Fond for a classic St. Barts experience. Just make sure to wear water shoes to protect your feet from the rocky terrain and sea urchins. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Petit Cul-de-Sac\\n\\n Home to another natural pool, Petit Cul-de-Sac is a protected lagoon that\\'s great for snorkeling and enjoying a quiet beach. It\\'s located on the eastern end of the island. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Explore the island\\'s capital, Gustavia\\n\\n Gustavia is the capital and main town of St. Barts, wrapping a U shape around the harbor. Here, visitors can simply stroll the many upscale boutiques and art galleries, find a place to eat, book water sports with a local outfitter, enjoy the nightlife, or wander to the ruins of Fort Gustave or Fort Karl. Other interesting activities include learning a bit of island history at the Wall House Museum and visiting the Vieux Clocher (the oldest building in Gustavia). \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Lolita Jaca\\n\\n Address: day shop at Les Hauts du Carré d\\'Or (above Chopard) and night shop next to Bonito, Gustavia, 97133 Saint-BarthélemyPhone: +590 590 275 998; +590 590 298 642Website \\n Lolita Jaca was born in St. Barts and it\\'s easy to tell.

The line now also features beachwear, ready-to-wear fashion, and beach accessories, so it\\'s a great spot to complete your St. Barts beach look. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n St. Barts is only 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide, so it\\'s quite small, and driving around it takes about 30 minutes max. The island\\'s separate neighborhoods are not divided up as distinctly as on other islands, but there are still two main neighborhoods you should know about, because most visitors choose to stay in proximity to these two spots. \\n Gustavia: Gustavia is the capital of St. Barts and the island\\'s main town. This is where you\\'ll find a hub of activity, from shopping to groceries to galleries, businesses, and restaurants. Wander the streets at your leisure or simply enjoy watching the yachts in the harbor that the town encircles. \\n St. Jean: The tiny village of St. Jean is the most popular place for tourists outside of Gustavia; it also has great restaurants and shopping, and is close to the island\\'s only airport. Here, you\\'ll also find the picture-perfect crescent of sand called St. Jean Beach, where there\\'s a natural coral reef to enjoy if you can manage to pry yourself off the sand. Eden Rock and Nikki Beach are along the same stretch. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n The weather in St. Barts is tropical and relatively warm year-round. There are two \"seasons\": from December through May, expect milder temperatures; June through November, the weather is warmer. \\n However, the differences are not extreme: it\\'s about 80 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and can get up to 90 in the summer. The water also stays warm, so it\\'s never a bad season to swim. \\n Hurricanes are possible between June and November during the Atlantic hurricane season, especially in September and October. St. Barts suffered significant damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017. \\n The following are average Fahrenheit lows and highs by month. The average precipitation is about 40 inches per year, and August to November tend to be the wettest months. In every month, expect eight to nine hours of sunshine per day. \\n January 73 - 84February 73 - 84March 73 - 84April 75 - 86May 77 - 88June 79 - 90July 79 - 90August 79 - 90September 79 - 90October 79 - 88November 77 - 88December 75 - 86 \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Saint Barts Taxi: Find the closest taxi near you in St. BartsiPhone | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'At just 84 square miles, you\\'d think St. Croix would fly right under the radar. But in the U.S. Virgin Islands, those miles stack up to make it the largest island in the archipelago. And every square inch is brimming with something special for visitors. So, bookmark this page for your next trip to St. Croix to remember everything you should see, do, and explore on the island paradise. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Getting to St. Croix\\n\\n St. Croix is relatively accessible to U.S.-based travelers. Several leading air carriers (American, JetBlue, Spirit, and Delta) operate nonstop flights from major gateways like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte, and Atlanta. Perhaps most convenient for this set of travelers is the fact Americans do not need a passport to enter, as the island is an unincorporated U.S. territory. \\n However, Americans will notice one major difference upon landing: The local population drives on the left. But the transition is easy, thanks to \"Keep Left\" road signs and stickers prominently displayed in rental cars and road signs providing helpful reminders along the way. \\n \\n\\nHeading: St. Croix History and Culture\\n\\n While on the island, visitors may catch a glimpse of several different flags swaying in the breeze, including the Dannebrog, the national flag of Denmark. This is a holdover from the island\\'s colonial-era past, prior to the purchase by the U.S. and its transition of power in 1917. \\n The culture on the island is a deep combination of African, European, Caribbean, native Carib and Taino, and American heritages. It\\'s a place where storytelling and music can be found on every corner and town square, and it\\'s a good idea to stop, learn, and appreciate what makes this destination and its locals so special. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best St. Croix Beaches, Hikes, Shops, Restaurants, and More\\n\\n St. Croix appeals to a broad range of adventurous and culturally curious travelers. The island\\'s twin towns, Christiansted in the east and Frederiksted in the west, offer a wealth of shopping, fine dining, art, and historical attractions. \\n Fort Frederik in Frederiksted is historically significant from an Afro-conscious perspective. It was here, in 1848, that the proclamation freeing all enslaved Africans throughout the Danish West Indies was made. A bust commemorating General Buddhoe, a formerly enslaved person who led the insurrection that proved pivotal in earning emancipation, sits just outside the fort\\'s weathered red walls. Additional historical attractions in Frederiksted include the Estate Whim Great House and Museum (the only sugar plantation museum in the Virgin Islands) and the Lawaetz Museum. \\n Christiansted is also home to several centuries-old attractions. Fort Christiansvaern forms the centerpiece of the Christiansted National Historic Site, a collection of carefully restored Danish colonial structures dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. \\n Arguably, the bigger draws in Christiansted, however, are the shopping and dining venues. Here, exciting foodie adventures and one-of-a-kind buys await in cafes, restaurants, and boutiques housed in distinctive structures pulled right from the past. \\n Top restaurants in the neighborhood include Savant, Café Christine, Galangal, and Rum and Wine Bar Restaurant. Meanwhile, savvy shoppers keen on collecting unique mementos won\\'t want to miss Sonya\\'s, home of the original St. Croix hook bracelet. Crucian Gold and ib Designs are also big on producing fine, handmade jewelry born and bred on the island. \\n Away from the twin towns, St. Croix\\'s beaches, hiking, championship golf courses, snorkeling, and scuba diving options fill days with thrills that keep travelers coming back for more. \\n For a stunning view, put in the work with a hike up Goat Hill, where you\\'ll enjoy the full expanse of the island extending westward and the easternmost point of the U.S., Point Udall, to the east. \\n The Jack and Isaac Bay Preserve below Goat Hill allows travelers to combine hiking and beachcombing in one rewarding adventure. Low-impact trails lead to the remote, unspoiled beaches lined with sugar-white sand, lush trees, and blessedly nothing else. \\n Additional hiking trails are also available at Buck Island, a small, uninhabited island just off St. Croix\\'s northeast shore. Buck Island and its surrounding reef and waters lie within the Buck Island Reef National Monument, a protected natural environment managed by the U.S. National Park Service. Hiking adventures here are a boon for bird-watchers or anyone seeking to commune with nature in peace and tranquility. An undersea snorkeling trail along the Buck Island Reef makes it easy for visitors to familiarize themselves with the coral and sea creatures that call these protected waters home. \\n Several tour operators offer half-and full-day excursions to Buck Island. Chief among them is Captain Carl of Buck Island Charters. The family-owned charter company provides a nonmotorized full-sail Buck Island experience aboard trimaran sailing vessels. \\n For scuba divers, nothing beats the fun at The Wall at Cane Bay. One of the world\\'s renowned dive sites, The Wall drops to depths in excess of 13,000 feet. The deep waters here teem with out-of-this-world wildlife and coral formations. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best St. Croix Resorts\\n\\n The leading hotels and resorts in St. Croix are a bit different than those found on other Caribbean islands. In place of large, all-inclusive properties and familiar international brand names, St. Croix hotels are generally smaller and more intimate. Often, they echo the island\\'s rich history. And many of the newest hotels are actually updated and reimagined versions of older, historic properties. \\n The Buccaneer Beach and Golf Resort truly has it all: a stunning 18-hole championship golf course, modern tennis facilities, a full-service spa, multiple dining options, three beaches, and an array of water sports equipment. The estate was originally founded in 1653, when the Knights of Malta controlled St. Croix. Historic remnants of the old plantation, like the sugar mill that sits astride the main entrance to the hotel lobby, remain on the grounds. The property was converted into a hotel in 1947, earning The Buccaneer the distinction of being the oldest family-owned and operated property in the Caribbean. \"Book a room with an ocean-view balcony and take advantage of having three beaches on property, said T+L editorial director Nina Ruggiero after a 2018 stay. \"Mermaid Beach is for activites —\\xa0rent snorkels, paddle boards, and kayaks — or you can relax on the quieter Grotto and Whistle Beaches.\" \\n Nestled in the heart of downtown Christiansted, the historic Company House Hotel is a cozy and freshly remodeled oasis of refinement built on simplicity. A somewhat secret grotto pool and an elegant mahogany bar in the lobby serve as the two main gathering points. There\\'s no restaurant, though this encourages guests to seek out the many fantastic restaurants that have recently elevated Christiansted into a culinary hot spot in the area. \\n The most stylish hotel to open in St. Croix in a generation, The Fred sits right on the waterfront of its namesake town, Frederiksted, on the west coast of the island. Formerly a private residence, the property\\'s structure dates back to the 18th century. The swanky pool, elevated sundeck, party-sized Jacuzzi, half-moon bar, and boardwalk above the beach are all new additions to the building. \\n What\\'s old is new again (and much improved) at the Feather Leaf Inn. Formerly known as Estate Butler\\'s Bay, the property is an 18th-century Danish sugar plantation. Rather than glorifying its dark, colonial past, Feather Leaf builds on its agrarian roots, emphasizing healthy, plant-based food and sustainable tourism. Much of the grounds are devoted to developing a seaside botanical forest filled with tropical fruits and herbs. As for the accommodations, nine guest rooms are spread among three separate buildings, and each is 100% solar-powered, distinctively styled, and features jaw-dropping sunset views over a calm, secluded bay. \\n',\n",
              "  \"All Caribbean islands are not created equal. Some embody the quintessential fairy-tale facets of the tropical paradise, with sugar-sand beaches and awe-inspiring natural wonders. St. John, one of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands, fits this bill. \\n The island is mainly accessible by boat, though car and passenger ferry service operate all day from nearby and much more cosmopolitan St. Thomas. Many visitors also arrive by private yacht. Anyone wanting to come by plane, though, is out of luck as there's no airport here. \\n In addition to being the most remote of the primary U.S. Virgin Islands, St. John is also the smallest, clocking in at just 20 square miles. But this tiny package is loaded with some of the best that the U.S. Virgin Islands has to offer. \\n A great deal of those bests center on eco-travel pursuits, as two-thirds of the island is covered by the Virgin Islands National Park, established in 1956. The Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, established in 2001, further expands environmental protections to the undersea world surrounding the island. \\n The result is an unspoiled paradise — no passport required — offering innumerable opportunities to connect with the natural environment by land and sea. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit St. John\\n\\n The better question is: What time is good for you? St. John is blessed with a magical combination of warm weather and persistently cooling trade winds throughout the year. During the day, the highs average around the low to mid-80s, while overnight temperatures generally hover within the low 70s. \\n Rain? Nestled, as it is, in the heart of the tropics, St. John does see its fair share of rain. The island's verdant hills wouldn't be so beautifully green without it. However, there's no set rainy season. At the same time, you certainly wouldn't consider St. John a desert island. Instead, rain generally tends to come and go, rarely washing out full days, much less multiple days in a row. Months with the highest precipitation: September, October, and November. \\n Crowds? If they aren't your thing, then you may want to steer clear of the peak winter season, which runs from mid-December through March. In a bit of a surprise, though, crowds are also always big in the middle of the summer for July Fourth. The reason: St. John Carnival, which kicks off in early June with a number of low-key pageants and concerts. The excitement builds throughout the month, culminating on Emancipation Day (July 3) and Independence Day (July 4) with a parade, fireworks, and nonstop fun and concerts in the Carnival Village. \\n On the opposite end of the fun spectrum is hurricane season, spanning from June through November. Late August to mid-October tends to constitute the peak period for storms, with major hurricanes being rare in June, July, and November. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do on St. John\\n\\n No matter what time of year you visit St. John, you'll always find a plethora of fun things to do. Top of the list for many is enjoying the island's many unspoiled beaches. \\n Trunk Bay, Cinnamon Bay, and Maho Bay are the most famous — and for good reason. The stunning seascapes along these shores are the stuff of Caribbean beach fantasies. At the same time, though, lesser-known shores, like those lining Honeymoon Beach, Leinster Bay, Jumbie Bay, Francis Bay, and Salomon Bay, should not be overlooked. \\n Several of St. John's best beaches are solely accessible by a second favorite activity here: hiking. \\n St. John's 20 square miles are crisscrossed with a network of more than 20 hiking trails. Many are of the low- to medium-impact variety, with some measuring less than three miles. All of them, though, lead to amazing natural wonders or historical attractions worth discovering. \\n One such historical attraction, known simply as the petroglyphs, opens a rare window into one of the Caribbean's indigenous inhabitants: the Taino Indians. \\n Ancient tribal carvings left here centuries ago are set into a rock wall at the base of a waterfall located deep within the Reef Bay valley. If possible, plan to hike out here after a healthy rain to get the full effect of this mystical place. When trekking out to the petroglyphs along the Reef Bay Trail, hikers also pass the ruins of four colonial-era sugar estates. This offers unique access to yet another era of St. John's storied history. \\n However, not all of St. John's trails run over dry ground. The Coral Reef Underwater Park Trail at Trunk Bay, for example, introduces snorkelers to the island's colorful undersea world. A series of signs along the trail tell of the different coral and fish species snorkelers may encounter. \\n When not trekking through the bush or diving underwater in search of St. John's natural treasures, visitors delight in traipsing around the famously eclectic shops and boutiques in Cruz Bay, St. John's main town. Mongoose Junction, in particular, is popular for handmade local jewelry and artwork, as well island fashion, gifts, and more. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay on St. John\\n\\n As you might expect in a destination as dynamic and eco-focused as St. John, accommodation options are vast and varied. One thing you won't find here, though, is all-inclusive resorts. But what it lacks in all-inclusive amenities, it makes up for in features that get you closer to the heart of what makes this little island so special. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Westin St. John Resort Villas\\n\\n The Westin St. John Resort extends along 1,200 feet of pristine, white-sand beach, covering a total of 47 acres with studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom accommodations. Guests can even opt for a townhouse (2,850 square feet) with space for up to eight adults. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Cinnamon Bay Beach & Campground\\n\\n For those keen on visiting St. John to connect with nature, Cinnamon Bay Beach & Campground is a solid choice. Cottages, eco-tents, and bare sites are available, offering guests the opportunity to choose just how much they want to rough it. Here, waves crash along Cinnamon Bay, lulling you sleep. Mornings start with a dip in a pretty beach. And wild donkeys vie for the best shaded spots on the sand. For true nature lovers, it doesn't get much better than this. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Estate Lindholm\\n\\n Originally established as a plantation by Dutch settlers in the 1720s, Estate Lindholm today offers stunning views from its hilltop perch high above Cruz Bay. The property has 17 guest rooms, each decked out in elegant furnishings and decor echoing 300 years of St. John history. \\n \\n\\nHeading: St. John Villa Rentals\\n\\n Undoubtedly the most popular form of guest accommodations on St. John are villa rentals. For the best rates on the widest selection of properties, St. John Villa Rentals is great option. Booking through this community of local owners and property managers ensures that travelers avoid added service fees. \\n\",\n",
              "  'Don\\'t be surprised if you find yourself contemplating a move to Sweden after a visit to Stockholm; the city makes traveling feel easy and effortless (even for newbies). Locals tend to be welcoming and friendly, English is widely spoken, and everything from the subway system to city streets are clean and straight-forward. \\n But beyond ease of travel, Stockholm delivers a one-of-a-kind experience thanks to its placement on an archipelago of 14 islands that each offer a distinct feel—from the colorful buildings and cobblestone streets of Gamla Stan to the nature-rich isle of Djurgården. It\\'s a place where you can hop on a public ferry and find yourself in a different world without ever leaving the city. And no matter where you end up, you\\'ll find yourself at ease in the contemporary, urban feel Sweden is known for. Just make sure to make time for fika, a coffee and cake break, so you can slow down and enjoy life like the locals do. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Time (GMT+2) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Sweden can be chilly, making the summer months an ideal time to visit.

              "  'Famously photogenic Sydney is Australia\\'s largest city and the capital of New South Wales, the country\\'s most visited state. \\n The traditional home of the Gadigal people of the Eora Aboriginal Nation, Sydney has evolved from a humble British penal colony founded in 1788 to a thriving port city. \\n Today, nearly half of Sydney\\'s residents, known as \"Sydneysiders,\" were born overseas. The city’s rich cultural makeup is now reflected in its diverse food scene, where just about every major international cuisine is represented in increasingly creative ways. \\n Among the city\\'s most recognizable attractions are the iconic Sydney Opera House, with its distinctive white \"sails,\" and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, affectionately known as the \"coat hanger.\" But there is plenty more to love about this showstopping waterside metropolis. \\n Sydney\\'s moderate climate and variety of beaches and parks make it ideal for outdoor activities, and an ever-expanding roster of luxury hotels offer plenty of options to lay your head at the end of each day. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) UTC/GMT +10 hoursFrom approximately October through March — Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT) UTC/GMT +11 \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Australia is located in the Southern Hemisphere, with opposite seasons to the Northern Hemisphere.

              "  \"The weather is getting warmer, and summer is inching closer, which can only mean one thing: Hamptons season is nearly upon us. Read on for the ultimate guide to planning the perfect Hamptons vacation — including when to visit, where to stay, and what to do. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go to the Hamptons\\n\\n Although the Hamptons is divine in its high season (summer), don't discount Long Island's South Fork during its less popular periods. May and September — two months often referred to as the shoulder season — are great times to visit this New York area. Prices are lower, crowds are thinner, and many restaurants are already open. Plus, because the Hamptons is insulated on all sides, the temperature is a bit warmer than it typically is in New York City, meaning beach weather arrives a few weeks earlier and lingers a few weeks later. \\n So, don't feel confined to June, July, and August when making your vacation plans. The best time to visit the Hamptons is before the crowds descend and right after they leave. \\n \\n\\nHeading: East Hampton or Southampton?\\n\\n The two towns that comprise the Hamptons — East Hampton and Southampton — offer vastly different landscapes, and where you end up depends on your vibe. If you're looking for a laid-back, surfer experience, the towns to the east may suit your style: East Hampton, Amagansett, and Montauk have beautiful beaches, excellent restaurants, and a bit more of a relaxed atmosphere. Meanwhile, Springs, which has traditionally been home to locals and artists, remains an under-the-radar destination for those seeking less crowded bay beaches and superlative sunsets. \\n The town of Southampton, to the west, includes the hamlets of Bridgehampton, part of Sag Harbor, Sagaponack, and Southampton Village. If you're looking for a more formal Hamptons experience, this may be the slice of East End for you. Old estates, galas, and polo matches are de rigueur on this side of the town line. If this sounds like your shade of rosé, raise a glass to all things Southampton. \\n And what about Westhampton Beach? This village, which lies to the west of the Shinnecock Canal, is not officially considered part of the famed Hamptons, even though it's also home to an impressive array of beachfront mansions along Dune Road. Westhampton's shops, restaurants, and beaches are reason enough for a non-Hamptons visit, if you're looking to get close. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Where to Stay in the Hamptons\\n\\n Few properties offer a more compelling stay than Montauk's Crow's Nest, where bohemian decor, twinkling Edison bulbs, and a view of Lake Montauk at sunset are just part of hotelier Sean MacPherson's surf-centric vision. The hotel's mix of rooms and cottages runs adjacent to its much-beloved Mediterranean-style restaurant, which is always booming from May through September. \\n Further west, at the 15-key Roundtree, in Amagansett, guests can explore the boutique property alone or with a furry friend (the hotel is pet-friendly). Beach bonfires, cooking classes, trips to local wineries, and guided walking tours are all signature experiences offered for a bespoke Hamptons getaway. \\n In Sag Harbor, the 67-room Baron's Cove offers guests a resort experience, with upscale amenities like a pool and on-site restaurant and an incomparable view of the water. Open year-round, there's not a bad time to visit the property, which boasts a cozy dining room and fireplace. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Beaches in the Hamptons\\n\\n Where should you spend your time sunning during your time out east? That's partially a matter of preference. If you're not local to the Hamptons, there are a number of options in terms of paid day parking lots. Cooper's Beach, in Southampton, is a wide, long beach with amenities and a large lot. \\n In Sag Harbor, Foster Memorial Beach (otherwise known as Long Beach) is ideal for those who prefer to swim in shallow, calm waters or like a little less of a hike from the sand. It's also open to the public. \\n Amagansett's Atlantic Avenue Beach is open to the public and has lifeguards, concessions, and restrooms, as well as an active surf break. And at the end, in Montauk, Kirk Park Beach's pay lot offers restrooms and a modest hike over spectacular dunes, where, in the heart of summer, lucky visitors may just see whales breaching offshore. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do in the Hamptons\\n\\n Chill out after a morning at the beach by strolling through the perfectly manicured gardens at Sagaponack's Madoo Conservancy. Established in 1967 by artist, writer, and gardener Robert Dash, this stunning space is like stepping into a fantasy dreamscape. \\n If the weather is less than beachy, head over to Bridgehampton's Scuttle Hole Road for Channing Daughters Winery's seated tastings (reservations are recommended). You can even make a whole day of it, stopping by Wölffer Estate Vineyard, in neighboring Sagaponack, for a glass of the winery's esteemed rosé, followed by a digestif at the South Fork's very own Sagaponack Farm Distillery. \\n Pick up a loaf of still-warm olive ciabatta at Carissa's Bakery (there are two East Hampton locations). And, of course, no trip to the Hamptons would be complete without dinner at East Hampton's decades-old celebrity magnet, Nick & Toni's (make your reservation in advance). \\n\",\n",
              "  'Tokyo is a city of surprises — ancient temples are nestled among modern skyscrapers and you\\'re just as likely to see someone wearing a cosplay costume as you are to see someone dressed in a traditional kimono. And even though Tokyo is the most populated city in the world, the streets can be almost eerily silent. You\\'ll find every modern convenience (and then some), but because Japan was closed off to the rest of the world for many years, tech evolved in a way that reflects the Japanese psyche, English is not widely spoken, and the far-reaching effect of globalization is still minimal. It is a true breath of fresh air among the myriad destinations that lost themselves in their quest to cater to tourists and meet global ideals. \\n These contradictions and surprises make Tokyo a city that leaves you curious, fascinated, and wanting more. In a single day you can visit a 7th-century temple, order ramen from a vending machine, and watch a sumo match. There is no shortage of things to do, see, and eat in Tokyo, and while its citizens tend to be respectful and accommodating, they too, like to keep you on your toes. Swing by a maid cafe or a Babymetal concert and you\\'ll know what I mean. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Japan Standard Time (GMT+9) \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n The best time to visit Tokyo is in the spring, when the cherry blossoms bloom (typically March to April) and in the autumn, when the weather cools and the fall colors pop (between September and November). That being said, the weather in Tokyo is fairly temperate — even in the winter — although it can be hot and humid from late June to the end of August. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Yen(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: Japanese \\n I don\\'t speak Japanese: Watashi wa nihongo o hanasemasen \\n I\\'m lost: Michinimayoimashita \\n I would like…: O onegaishimasu… \\n Calling Code: +81 \\n Capital City: Tokyo \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: It\\'s not shocking that trains are the preferred method of transportation around Tokyo. In fact, the city is so big the train system is divided into two companies: the Tokyo Metro and the Toei Subway. Between the two, there\\'s nowhere in Tokyo you can\\'t access. Just keep in mind that because of Tokyo\\'s sheer size (and amazing train coverage) the metro and subway map can be confusing —make sure to download the Tokyo Subway Navigation for Tourists app before you set out. \\n Buses: Because the train system is so easy and comprehensive, most people skip the bus. But, it does exist. The Toei Bus runs throughout Tokyo and to neighboring suburbs. \\n Taxis: There are several taxi companies in Tokyo — all sporting various colors. In addition, you can hop in an Uber.Car service: There are private car services aplenty in Tokyo — including Tokyo Car Service and Blacklane. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Hoshino Resorts OMO5 Tokyo Otsuka\\n\\n 2 Chome-26-1 Kitaotsuka, Toshima City, Tokyo 170-0004 JapanPhone: +81 570-073-022Book Now \\n For an upscale, yet casual hotel with easy access to the metro, it\\'s hard to top OMO5 Tokyo Otsuka under the Hoshino Resorts umbrella. The property has ultra-modern rooms, a welcoming lounge, and a team of OMO Rangers — locals ready to take you on a tour of the neighborhood. The area, which straddles Ikebukuro and Sugamo, has a retro feel with streetcars and narrow streets lined with bakeries and ramen spots. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Aman Tokyo\\n\\n Address: The Otemachi Tower, 1 Chome-5-6 Ōtemachi, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 100-0004 JapanPhone: +81 3-5224-3333Book Now \\n One of Tokyo\\'s finest five-star hotels, Aman Tokyo, offers a stellar vantage point over the city (and on clear days to Mount Fuji) thanks to its location at the top of the Otemachi Tower. The hotel balances its urban, modern feel with a dose of traditional Japanese design — washi paper doors, ryokan-style rooms, and ikebana displays (Japanese flower displays). The balance between tradition and modern convenience flows into Aman Tokyo\\'s guest rooms and suites and into the expansive Aman Spa. \\n \\n\\nHeading: The Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo\\n\\n Address: 9 Chome-7-1 Akasaka, Minato City, Tokyo 107-6245, JapanPhone: +81 3-3423-8000Book Now \\n The Ritz-Carlton brand is associated with excellence, and their luxury hotel in Tokyo is no exception.

But look a little deeper, and you\\'ll find a hotel with easy access to the Asakusa Station and the Sensō-ji temple (a top Tokyo attraction) with bathing facilities that will challenge even the most high-end Tokyo hotels. The beautiful traditional Japanese bathing area includes indoor and open-air baths in addition to various saunas. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Onsen Ryokan Yuen Shinjuku\\n\\n Address: 5 Chome-3-18 Shinjuku, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0022, JapanPhone: +81 3-5361-8355Book Now \\n Onsen Ryokan Yuen Shinjuku may be located mere minutes from the bustling downtown neighborhood of Shinjuku, but somehow the contemporary hotel manages to maintain a sense of calm and tranquility. Perhaps the hotel\\'s standout feature is its traditional ryokan feel (Japanese inn), bathing facilities, and its open-air bathhouse fed by natural hot spring water. The rooms are modern, yet cozy and the on-site restaurant uses traditional techniques and local, seasonal ingredients to wow guests on the plate. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Wired Hotel Asakusa\\n\\n Address: 2 Chome-16-2 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032, JapanPhone: +81 3-5830-6533Book Now \\n For a truly trendy Tokyo escape, head to this three-star hotel near Asakusa Station and the Tokyo Skytree. The Wired Hotel has everything from budget rooms to high-end suites with floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies.

And while there are plenty of amazing ramen spots throughout the city, one of the best is Kikanbo, which serves up giant bowls of goodness made using a rich broth, Shinshu Miso, perfectly chewy noodles, and carefully selected spices (fair warning: If you order this soup spicy, you\\'ll get spicy). Order at the vending machine outside, hand your ticket to the chef, and await your steaming hot bowl of goodness. No reservation is needed and seating is indoors. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Udon Shin\\n\\n Address: 2-20-16 Yoyogi, Shibuya City, Tokyo 151-0053, JapanPhone: +81 03-6276-7816Website \\n You might run into a line at the low-key Udon Shin, but the thick hand-rolled udon noodles are well worth every minute. There are plenty of ways to order your udon — in hot broth, with a dipping broth, or cold — but any way is sure to leave you full and happy by the time you leave. Dining is indoors and no reservations are needed — just show up early so you don\\'t get too hungry while you wait. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Sushi Kanesaka\\n\\n Address: 8-10-3 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0061, JapanPhone: +81 3-5568-4411Website \\n For a Michelin-starred sushi experience, head to Sushi Kanesaka in Ginza, a restaurant known for its superior omakase (which translates to \"I leave it up to you\" — as in, chef\\'s choice). Each sushi roll served meets strict traditional standards and maintains a careful balance between rice, the topping, and the wasabi. Seating is indoors and reservations are recommended. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Tamawarai\\n\\n Address: 5 Chome-23-3 Jingumae, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0001, JapanPhone: +81 3-5485-0025Website \\n It would be a shame to travel all the way to Tokyo and miss one of the country\\'s most beloved dishes. While one could argue soba noodles are always delicious, those served at Tamawarai are something special — the owner and chef mills the buckwheat himself and it shows. The flavor pops in each soba laden dish. Swing by (no reservation) and enjoy the calming simplicity of the indoor dining room. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Onigiri Bongo\\n\\n Address: 2 Chome−26−3 Kitaotsuka, Toshima City, Tokyo 170-0004 JapanPhone: +81 3-3910-5617Website \\n Located in the food-laden neighborhood of Otsuka, this restaurant takes a Japanese staple — onigiri (stuffed rice balls) — and elevates it. You can drop in, sit at the counter (no reservation needed), and order your fillings of choice from the chef while enjoying a warm green tea. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n \\n\\nHeading: Sumo Tournament at Ryōgoku Kokugikan\\n\\n Address: 1 Chome-3-28 Yokoami, Sumida City, Tokyo 130-0015, JapanPhone: +81 3-3623-5111Website \\n Sumo is as synonymous with Japan as sushi, and if you time it right you can take in one of the annual official sumo tournaments that takes place at Ryōgoku Kokugikan, also known as Ryōgoku Sumo Hall.

Here, you\\'ll find endless street vendors serving up unbelievably fresh sushi and delicacies like squid-ink sticky buns.

In addition to a traditional sentō experience, you\\'ll find yoga classes, gourmet coffee, and craft beer at this hidden gem. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\\n\\n Address: 11 Naitomachi, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0014, JapanPhone: +81 3-3350-0151Website \\n Japan is known for their elegant, yet simple gardens, but none are more stunning than the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. In addition to housing native, traditional gardens, you\\'ll find landscapes inspired by French and English gardens and beautiful water features.

Inside are over 300 shops and restaurants ranging from souvenir spots to high-end clothing shops. \\n \\n\\nHeading: R for D\\n\\n Address: 1-4-5, Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-0041, JapanPhone: +81 3-6407-9320Website \\n This trendy boutique is the go-to place to find clothing by Japanese designers, and it\\'s hard to leave without picking something up. From graphic tees to silk dresses and boundary-pushing fashion with a distinct Japanese flair. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Ginza 6\\n\\n Address: 6 Chome-10-1 Ginza, Chuo City, Tokyo 104-0061, JapanPhone: +81 3-6891-3390Website \\n In the central Ginza district of Tokyo you\\'ll find this luxury shopping complex. The concept behind the department store is \"world class,\" so you can expect to find almost everything with an upscale twist — from restaurants to books and art. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Harajuku: It doesn\\'t get much more hip than Harajuku, a neighborhood known for youth fashion, cool vintage and cosplay shops, and colorful street art. When you\\'ve had your fill of people watching on Takeshita Street, head to Omotesando Avenue for a dose of more traditional (and high-end) boutiques. \\n Asakusa: Tokyo may be a bright, modern city, but certain neighborhoods retain a sense of old-world charm. Asakusa, home to Sensō-ji temple and Nakamise Street, which is lined with traditional street food and craft shops, still gives off the feel of ancient Tokyo. In addition to drawing tourists, the area hosts events and festivals along the river and has a bustling dining scene. \\n Shimokitazawa: Shimokitazawa may be a bit more of a trip, but it\\'s worth every second. The neighborhood is packed with stylish stores selling everything from vintage clothing to records. When you\\'ve had your fill of shopping (and people watching) you can swing by one of the many cafes and restaurants. \\n Shinjuku Golden Gai: The neighborhood of Shinjuku has just about everything you could ever need or want, but one corner of the area is particularly special — the Golden Gai is a network of narrow alleys and passageways filled with uber tiny bars that only seat a few people.Shibuya City: Chances are you\\'ll make it to Shibuya at some point during your journey, and while the neighborhood is most known for the Shibuya Crossing, it also houses two of the busiest railway stations in the world and has excellent shopping. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring: It\\'s hard to top spring in Tokyo, especially if you happen to catch the annual cherry blossom bloom. The weather tends to hover between the early 40s and mid 70s (the latter being in May) and averages around 5 inches of rain a month. \\n Summer: Summer in Tokyo can be warm — with temperatures reaching the high 80s — but air conditioning is everywhere and there are plenty of tree-laden parks for escaping the heat. \\n Fall: After the spring cherry blossom season, fall is easily the best time to visit Tokyo. The temperature is comfortable and the autumn foliage can be vibrant against the modern cityscape.Winter: It doesn\\'t get frigid in Tokyo temperature wise (it usually floats between 35 and 54-degrees), but because the city is on the water, it can feel colder than it is. If you go during the winter months bundle up and plan out plenty of indoor activities. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n Uber: Ride hailing, electric bikes and motorized scooters, food deliveryiOs | Android \\n Google Translate: word translation with offline capabilitiesiOs | Android \\n Tokyo Subway Navigation: Tokyo metro map, route planning, route updatesiOs | Android \\n The Infatuation: Guide to restaurants near you with in-app reviewsiOs | Android \\n',\n",
              "  'What makes your city great? Ask anyone who hails from Toronto and they\\'ll proudly say diversity. With 2.9 million residents from more than 250 ethnic groups, speaking more than 180 languages, it\\'s no surprise that the city\\'s motto is \"Diversity, Our Strength\". \\n In recent years, Canada\\'s largest city has experienced a shift in character, output and self-confidence, creating a fascinating and increasingly complex place. This may be due to amazing musical and cultural talents that shoot to international success – most notably Drake and The Weeknd – who help amplify Toronto\\'s cool factor. Or unforgettable sporting moments, such as when the Toronto Raptors won the 2019 NBA Championship, the first NBA finals played outside of the U.S. \\n This shift is also a sign of maturity due to economic, intellectual, and educational development. The city is known as \"Silicon Valley of the North\", because of its growing technology hub, and \"Hollywood North\" because of its strong film and TV industry. The food and beverage scene is also having its own renaissance that will blow your taste buds away, as local chefs and business owners draw inspiration from the multicultural city they\\'ve grown up in and reflect this in their food. \\n Regardless of what spurred Toronto\\'s caterpillar-to-butterfly moment, the city has a unique character and multiethnic voice that you\\'ll experience in no other place. T+L\\'s Toronto City Guide shows you what makes the city interesting, vibrant, fun and so very special. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Eastern Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n Not surprisingly, visiting Toronto during the warmer months of the year (late spring to mid-autumn) is the best time to experience the city. Although winter is cold and can be a pain, there are just as many things to see and do, just make sure to bundle up! \\n In spring/summer (May to mid-September) an innumerable amount of festivals, events and performances happen every weekend. Notable ones to catch are the Beaches International Jazz Festival, Toronto Caribbean Carnival (known as Caribana), Luminato, Pride, Toronto International Film Festival, and many other neighborhood events that are just as fun and delightful. \\n Winter activities in the city (December to February) are just as plentiful – just make sure to wear a good winter coat and thermal wear. Some great experiences include Toronto Christmas Market, Toronto Light Festival, Winterlicious, and outdoor ice-skating in public spaces such as The Bentway. This is also a perfect time to explore Toronto\\'s excellent museums and galleries, such as the Bata Shoe Museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario, who host a slew of indoor programs and activities for kids and adults. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Canadian \\n (Check the current exchange rate) \\n Canada does not have one or two dollar bills. This currency has been converted into coins; the loonie ($1) and toonie ($2). \\n In 2012, the Government of Canada phased out the penny from the country\\'s currency system for economic and environmental reasons. As a result, cash payments or cash transactions are rounded up or down to the nearest five-cent increment. \\n Canadian currency is colorful and pays homage to historical figures and key moments in the country\\'s history. In November 2018, The Bank of Canada released a new vertical $10 bill featuring Viola Desmond, a Canadian civil rights activist and Black businesswoman from Nova Scotia. \\n Contactless payment: Contactless or tap payment is a common payment system used by Canadians and nearly all retailers in the country.

Peruse our curated list of some of the best neighborhoods in the city to visit. \\n The Annex: Bordering the University of Toronto\\'s St. George campus, The Annex is a lively area populated by students and grand homes. Along its main stretch of Bloor Street West, experience affordable, friendly, and locally run businesses, cafes, and indie retail stores. An abundance of casual bars and diverse restaurants is at your fingertips, from sushi to pizza, where you\\'ll be spoiled for choice. For entertainment, check out Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema, the world\\'s largest documentary cinema, and Lee\\'s Palace, a rock concert hall that is a city institution. \\n Chinatown: A hub of activity day or night with sidewalk markets, innumerable Canadian souvenirs shops and Asian restaurants. During Lunar New Year, Chinatown is extra festive as the community celebrates this occasion with lion dances along the street and inside Dragon City Mall. Also in the neighborhood is the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), one of the largest art museums in North America. \\n Kensington Market: Next door to Chinatown, this bohemian village within the city contains an eclectic mix of cafes, vintage stores, and food markets largely untouched by the modern changes of time. Pedestrian Sundays are a popular event, taking place on the last Sunday of the month (from May to October), where the streets are closed to vehicle traffic and are teeming with music and activity. Make sure you snap a picture of the Kensington Market Garden Car, a local attraction and public art piece permanently parked at Augusta Ave and Oxford Street for more than 10 years. \\n Entertainment District: This was the epicenter of Toronto\\'s club district between the 1990s and early 2000s, but has largely gentrified to accommodate businesses and condo dwellers. The area still retains a few nightclubs but is mostly known for its selection of restaurants, bars, and thriving concert and live theatre venues such as Roy Thompson Hall, Princess of Wales Theatre, and the TIFF Bell Lightbox where you can catch a show or watch some of the world\\'s most acclaimed films. \\n King Street West: Formerly an area populated with industrial buildings and warehouses, King Street West has transformed into a bustling hub of popular bars, a thriving club scene, and cool shops, such as local favs SOMA Chocolatemaker and SPin Toronto. This stretch of coolness extends for approximately 1.2 miles from Spadina to Strachan Avenue. \\n Little Italy: This area along College Street West is lined with quaint restaurants and outdoor cafes surrounded by beautiful tree-lined streets with Edwardian period homes. Dine and explore at your leisure during the day – Café Diplomatico is a long-time community staple. At night the neighborhood turns into a lively hot spot with El Convento Rico, a Latin nightclub and drag show venue, and Revival Bar, a popular club and event space. \\n Old Town Toronto: The founding neighborhood of Toronto (originally named the Town of York) has the largest concentration of 19th century buildings in the province. This area has a wealth of local history, great restaurants and bars, and a thriving arts scene. Points of interest to take in are the photogenic Gooderham Building (locally known as the Flatiron Building), Berczy Park dog fountain, and Sugar Beach. Satisfy your taste buds at St. Lawrence Market, a world-renowned culinary haven, and stroll through the historic Distillery District, one of Canada\\'s premiere arts and culture destinations. \\n West Queen West: Day or night this westerly area along Queen Street West is home to a multitude of cool bars, vintage shops, and a diverse selection of locally run businesses. Two of the city\\'s beloved boutique hotels are found here – The Drake and Gladstone – as well as the ubiquitous Trinity Bellwoods Park, a popular spot to hang and partake in local community events. The vibe here is hip, young, and active – couple that with the above-mentioned points of interest and you immediately understand why Vogue named West Queen West one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world. \\n Yorkville: During the 1960s, this was a relaxed bohemian enclave, but is now an affluent and sophisticated area – Drake is known to frequent Yorkville and during the Toronto International Film Festival it teems with celebrities. Many upscale restaurants and international luxury retailers are found here, as well as long-time local purveyors of class Harry Rosen and Holt Renfrew. Yorkville is also a cultural destination where within a few hundred feet you can visit the Bata Shoe Museum, Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, Royal Ontario Museum, and Royal Conservatory of Music. \\n Toronto Islands: Hop on a ferry and get away to the Toronto Islands, a group of 15 interconnected islands that sit in Lake Ontario. It offers a relaxing respite for individuals and families from the bustling vibe of the downtown core. Take a dip at its beaches (note that Hanlan\\'s Point is a clothing-optional beach), rent sports and water equipment, enjoy a picnic, play at Centreville Amusement Park, or experience the quaintness of the 150-year-old community living year-round in cottage-style residences. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n In Toronto you\\'ll experience all four seasons of the year to Mother Nature\\'s maximum. Here, winter (December to February) means a lot of snow, wet rain, icy conditions and wind chill so intense it makes the city feel colder than the Mars.

Summer (June to August) has hot sunny days with extreme humidity and periodic thunderstorms.

              "  'memo06dic/Getty Images \\n Tulum, Mexico, is bursting with beautifully designed hotels, gorgeous beaches, and restaurants with great ambiance and even better food. It\\'s part of Mexico\\'s Riviera Maya, which was one of Travel + Leisure\\'s best places to go in 2023. Humming blissfully in the background of the busy beach clubs and posing influencers, Tulum\\'s spiritual centers offers great yoga, meditation classes, sacred ceremonies, and many more mind-expanding activities. Surrounding all this is a dense cenote-filled jungle and stunning nature reserves — perfect for dolphin spotting, cave diving, and riding ATVs. \\n Read on for the best places to stay, eat, and play in Tulum. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels & Resorts\\n\\n This 349-room luxury resort is the perfect place to sit back and relax. The property features five restaurants, six bars, five pools, and direct beach access. However, the massive spa steals the show with its open-air relaxation space that has a steam room, cold shower, sauna, ice plunge, and hot tub. T+L\\'s senior editor Maya Kachroo-Levine previously reported that her time at the Conrad Tulum was \"pure, luxurious\\xa0resort\\xa0fun,\" and was\"filled with sunrise soaks in our alfresco tub overlooking the ocean, mezcal Negronis at Ultramar pool bar, and visits to the build-your-own chilaquiles station at Arbolea restaurant each morning.\" \\n Sharing a property with the Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya, the Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya All-Inclusive Resort has 735 rooms and suites and 13 different eateries. Guests at either resort can access both hotels\\' amenities and restaurants, providing seemingly endless food and entertainment options.\\xa0\"The\\xa0picture-perfect beach, together with the eight pools and five jacuzzis, provide the ideal background to soak up the sun,\" T+L contributor, Dobrina Zhekova, reported from the hotel. \\n With 38 rooms, 20 exclusive suites, five luxury tree houses, and 36 Moroccan-inspired tents, this hotel is perfect for nature lovers and wellness-focused guests. \"Nômade Tulum favors the health-conscious with cacao ceremonies, spiritual talks, yoga classes complete with a live DJ soundtrack, and opportunities for nourishment by warm Caribbean winds at the hotel\\'s tree house lodgings,\" Rosie Bell, T+L contributor and Riviera Maya local, reported. Located on the quieter, more southern end of the beach road, guests are welcome to lounge beachside in whimsical hammocks and daybeds. \\n Filled with furniture and artwork handcrafted in Mexico, La Valise radiates a mixed jungle-glamour ambiance. There are just 11 bungalows in this boutique, but the most-coveted room is the beachfront primary suite, where the bed\\xa0rolls out onto the balcony, so you spend the night beneath the stars. All rooms are spacious with a light natural design, and the jungle-side suites have private outdoor showers. \\n Tucked away from the busy beach zone and city center, Hotel Bardo offers an array of luxurious and spacious lofts, each with its own private plunge pool. The main pool, fringed with greenery and plush daybeds, sits in the center of the hotel\\'s main social area, where a stone fire pit adds to the liveliness surrounding the bar and restaurant. Every day at sunset, guests are welcome to participate in an intention-setting ritual, and throughout the week, the hotel offers sound healing, yoga, and\\xa0temazcal\\xa0(a traditional sweat lodge) sessions. \\n Read More: The 25 Best Resort Hotels in Mexico, according to T+L’s 2022 World’s Best Awards \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Things to Do\\n\\n Tucked in the central La Veleta neighborhood, Holistika\\'s art walk is a short circular jungle path leading you past interactive sculptures and murals that seem to have crash-landed in the jungle. While you\\'re there, take advantage of one of the many yoga classes, ceremonies, or spa treatments, many of which happen in a gorgeous meditation dome. \\n You\\'ll find many of the Yucatán\\'s famous natural swimming holes around Tulum. Gran Cenote, Dos Ojos, and Laguna Kaan Luum are some of the area\\'s largest cenotes. However, don\\'t skip the smaller cenotes like Cenote Dos Palmas, which is looked after by members of the local Maya community. \\n Tulum\\'s Archaeological Zone was once an ancient Maya seaside port. Don\\'t miss the God of Winds Temple, and remember that you cannot climb on the impressive structures. \\n This yoga studio in the city center offers a wide range of classes and is the most affordable in Tulum, with a donation-based payment system. The studio has a community-centered feel and offers a variety of classes and yoga styles, including vinyasa and even acro-yoga. \\n Tulum Art Club offers a unique day trip to the inland city of Valladolid, where you can learn about Maya pottery from a family that has kept the Maya methods alive for centuries. During the workshop, you can learn more about the spiritual traditions of the family\\'s process and will get to take home your own creation. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n You can find all-natural soaps, oils, creams, and organic cosmetics at this beauty shop in the city center. Beauty treatments are available on-site, and all products are made in Mexico. \\n This slow-fashion brand specializes in gender-fluid resort wear made with linens sustainably sourced within 63 miles of Tulum. All pieces are designed and hand-crafted in Mexico. \\n On top of a great selection of flowing dresses, kaftans, and kimonos, this sustainable fashion brand has casual and formal menswear. The clothing combines Indigenous textiles and modern designs, and everything is handcrafted in Mexico. \\n Lara Antal/Travel + Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n This stylish beach road restaurant is \"a venue that perfectly embodies South Tulum\" reported T+L digital editorial director Nina Ruggiero. It serves up cocktails and food that emphasize local Mexican ingredients like\\xa0huitlacoche\\xa0(fermented corn) and\\xa0hoja santa\\xa0(Mexican pepper leaf). With the aroma of copal (the iconic pre-Columbian incense of choice in Tulum) permeating the space, the restaurant is warm and inviting. Reservations can be made online. \\n Dinner reservations are highly recommended for one of the most talked-about restaurants in the beach zone. \"Powered entirely by solar energy,\" T+L contributor Nate Storey\\xa0previously reported, \"nightly dinners [are prepared] over a wood-burning fire using organic Yucatán produce sourced from milpas, or organic farms, and spear-caught fish.\" To make dinner reservations, send an email to reservations@hartwoodtulum.com. Lunch reservations are not accepted, but walk-ins are encouraged. \\n You\\'ll find fresh seafood and friendly service at this local-favorite restaurant. The ceviches are popular, but you can\\'t go wrong with the garlic octopus or fish tacos. Portions are huge and perfect for sharing with friends. \\n This restaurant in the city center specializes in Asian/Mexican fusion. The menu is constantly changing, but you can expect to find tasty pork belly bao buns, plus sumptuous dishes like shrimp dumplings topped with tamarind sauce and a grasshopper garnish. Reservations are recommended. \\n You can pick up freshly baked loaves for breakfast at this bakery in the La Veleta neighborhood, but don\\'t leave without trying the desserts and Mexican pastries. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time To Visit\\n\\n The best time to visit Tulum is in the fall, between late October and mid-December, when hotel rates and reasonable, temperatures are starting to drop, and there\\'s minimal sargasso seaweed crowding the beaches. \\n Winter in Tulum is high season, so while the weather is pleasant, hotel rates tend to skyrocket, especially around Christmas and New Year\\'s. From May to October, Tulum, like the rest of the Caribbean, suffers from the hard-to-manage quantities of seaweed. \\n If you can plan your travels around a specific time of the month, consider visiting during the lunar cycle. Full moon parties are extremely popular in Tulum. Around this time, many spiritual centers and beach clubs host special moonlit events where visitors gather for either a dance party on the beach or a spiritual cleansing in the jungle. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Tulum for the Perfect Beach Vacation \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n Tulum currently does not have its own airport, though one is set to open at the end of 2023, as T+L\\'s Mexico expert, Sarah Bruning, previously reported. For now, you\\'ll want to fly into Cancun, which is serviced by all major U.S. airlines with nonstop flights from most major cities. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n Beach Zone:\\xa0Split into a northern and southern side, the beach zone is where you\\'ll find all the top hotels, restaurants, and beach clubs in Tulum, stretched out along a busy main road. The north side of the beach is quieter and closer to the ruins, while the south side has more hotels and restaurants. \\n Aldea Zama:\\xa0Halfway between town and the beach, this gated neighborhood is full of luxury condominiums, shopping, and restaurants. An upscale residential neighborhood, Aldea Zama is a great place to find a large vacation rental or a quieter hotel room. \\n Centro:\\xa0Centro is the center of daily life in Tulum, where you\\'ll find the best local restaurants, plus bookstores, cafes, and tons of souvenir shops. There are more affordable accommodation options here, and you\\'re more likely to find better prices on tours, bicycles, and moped rentals than at the beach. \\n Villas:\\xa0This is a small residential neighborhood with a few restaurants and no hotels. However, it\\'s a nice area for vacation rentals, with quiet streets decorated with larger-than-life murals. \\n Read More: How to Travel to the Riviera Maya \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Taxis:\\xa0Taxis are plentiful but pricey in Tulum. Most cabs are cash-only, and prices fluctuate depending on the traffic to and from your destination. Prices are negotiable, but you should agree on the price with the driver before you get in the car. You can book a taxi in advance using\\xa0Taxi! Riviera Maya. \\n Bicycles:\\xa0Biking is a very popular way to get around, thanks to the bike path that connects the city center to the beach road. Many hotels offer bike rentals, but you can also rent your own from a bike shop like\\xa0Ola Bike Tulum. \\n Scooters:\\xa0Motorized scooters can help you get to cenotes and attractions on the edge of town that may be too far to bike to. You will find the best deals on scooter rentals in the city center, where there are plenty of scooter shops. You can rent a scooter in advance from\\xa0Scooter Tulum Services; a one-day rental starts at 800 pesos ($44). \\n',\n",
              "  'Matt Anderson Photography/Getty Images \\n Turks and Caicos is home to some of the most mind-blowingly beautiful beaches in the world, with sand so white it practically glows. It\\'s an archipelago of 40 islands and cays, but there are eight main, inhabited islands. They\\'re separated into two groups: the Turks Islands (Grand Turk and Salt Cay) to the east of the Turks Island Passage and the Caicos Islands (South Caicos, Middle Caicos, North Caicos, Providenciales, Pine Cay, and Parrot Cay) to the west. \\n There\\'s no shortage of luxury hotels here. Rock House scored a spot in Travel + Leisure\\'s 2023 It List lineup as one of the best new hotels in the world. In the 2022\\xa0World\\'s Best Awards\\xa0survey,\\xa0T+L readers\\xa0chose three Turks and Caicos properties to land among the best resorts in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and the Bahamas. \\n The full name of the country is \"the Turks and Caicos Islands,\" though most people shorten it to \"Turks and Caicos\" or \"TCI.\" However, referring to the island chain as just \"Turks\" or \"Caicos\" is incorrect. \\n When visiting, plan on spending lots of time at the beach and in the water. Unlike more developed Caribbean islands, shopping and city tours take a backseat to the great outdoors here. The main activities are snorkeling, scuba diving, boating, and soaking up the sun. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Ambergris Cay is a 1,100-acre\\xa0private island\\xa0with 10 one-bedroom beachfront bungalows and eight three- to six-bedroom villas. The all-inclusive resort offers guests 24-hour room service, a private chef to prepare their meals, and activities like yoga classes and guided nature walks. T+L associate editorial director Alisha Prakash reported, \"Ambergris Cay defies the typical one-size-fits-all approach of lackluster all-inclusive resorts — there are no crowded pools, cheesy activities, basic buffets, or watered-down cocktails here. Instead, it remakes the genre, with private butlers and over-the-top villas and even round-trip air transfers to the island included in the rate.\" \\n Rock House is the latest addition to Grace Bay Resorts’ portfolio and was named one of the best new hotels of 2023 by T+L editors. The Mediterranean-inspired property has 46 accommodations from studios to two-bedroom villas — some villas even come with private pools. Its most notable feature is the 130-foot jetty that leads into the ocean. \\n Opened in the mid-2010s, The Shore Club Turks & Caicos is one of the newer hotels in Providenciales and was the first resort on Long Bay Beach. It features four pools, three restaurants, three bars, the Dune Spa, shopping, free use of non-motorized water sports equipment, a kids\\' club, and more. And the hotel was voted one of the best resorts in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and the Bahamas by T+L readers. \\n The Palms Turks and Caicos has a large infinity pool, a dedicated kids\\' club, an acclaimed spa, and alfresco dinners at the popular Parallel23 restaurant. The 72-suite property was also voted a top resort in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and the Bahamas by T+L readers. \\n Beach Enclave Turks & Caicos has three locations: Grace Bay, North Shore, and Long Bay. The one commonality across the three properties is that you\\'ll be treated to full-time butler service and meals prepared by a private chef. (Even the daily continental breakfast is delivered to the villa every morning.) This award-winning property has four- to seven-bedroom beachfront and hilltop villas that are anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 square feet. \\n Related: 10 Best Places to Travel in January \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Restaurants\\n\\n Perhaps the most well-known restaurant on the islands, Da Conch Shack is a Turks and Caicos staple. Located on Blue Hills Beach, guests dine with their toes in the sand as they enjoy live music, island flavors, and all things conch — from fritters to chowder to salad. Reservations recommended. \\n Bugaloo\\'s Conch Crawl is a must on any visit to Turks and Caicos: you can dine on the beach beneath the shade of coconut trees or in the ocean (swimming and beach attire are encouraged), listen to live music and entertainment, and sip endless rum punch. Reservations recommended. \\n Located at Point Grace Resort, Grace\\'s Cottage is considered one of the top fine-dining restaurant in Providenciales. Open for dinner only, this French-inspired spot offers both indoor and outdoor dining in a beautifully designed space. Reservations recommended. \\n The Sibonné Beach Hotel is one of the oldest on the island — and it still feels like a charming, old-school Caribbean inn. Their on-site restaurant, Bay Bistro, is no different, promising \"good food without an attitude.\" Expect freshly caught seafood and house-made desserts. Dining room, patio, and beachfront seating are available. Reservations recommended. \\n Head to Barbie\\'s on historic Front Street for conch fritters, cracked conch, fish sandwiches, and peas and rice. No reservations are required. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n Some of the most vibrant reefs for scuba diving are found in the West Caicos Marine National Park, at Northwest Point, in the Princess Alexandra National Park, and at the remote French Cay. Book a dive excursion with any number of outfitters on the islands — like this well-rated seven-hour scuba tour on Viator. \\n The Conch Bar Caves, located near the village of Conch Bar, is one of the largest non-submerged cave systems in the Caribbean. These limestone caves are home to a variety of rare wildlife, including bats and crustaceans. A guide is required to escort all visitors; visits can be arranged through Big Blue Collective. \\n Visit the islands\\' national museum, which features exhibits breaking down Turks and Caicos\\' history, starting from the ancient Lucayan people who first called these islands home. \\n If you love dogs, head to this dog rescue that helps local stray dogs find loving homes throughout North America. Visitors can stop by to take dogs for a walk or even volunteer to facilitate an adoption in the U.S. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Shopping\\n\\n The complex comprised of Saltmills Plaza, Regent Village Plaza, Grace Bay Plaza, and Le Vele Plaza makes up the central shopping district of Providenciales. Here, you\\'ll find gift shops, jewelry stores, clothing boutiques, and art galleries. At the Saltmills Plaza, make sure to pay a visit to The Wellington Collection, which features handmade jewelry and art made from conch shells and local sand. \\n The Middle Caicos Co-op represents more than 60 local artisans who produce baskets, hats, bags, paintings, model sailboats, conch shell art, and other souvenirs, all crafted by hand from natural materials. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Visit\\n\\n Tourism peaks in December, January, March, and April. During these months, the prices are higher and the islands are more crowded, but the weather is especially pleasant. \\n The weather in Turks and Caicos is generally hot and dry, with 350 days of sunshine in an average year. The days are hottest (and the water is warmest) in the summer, while November through May is milder. Hurricanes are possible between June and November during the Atlantic hurricane season. \\n Still, many consider springtime (February through April) the best time to visit Turks and Caicos because visitors are met with the ideal combination of good weather, lower prices, and plenty of availability. Steer clear of holiday weekends to find the best deals. \\n The Big South Regatta, which takes place every last weekend in May, is one of the islands\\' biggest annual events. It\\'s a traditional yacht regatta on South Caicos with plenty of entertainment planned around the islands for participants and spectators alike. The Conch Festival, held annually on the last weekend of November on Providenciales, is another major annual event. \\n Read More: The Best Times to Visit Turks and Caicos for Good Weather, Fewer Crowds, and Affordable Prices \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get There\\n\\n International flights arrive in Turks and Caicos from 11 countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Antigua, Puerto Rico, and the British Virgin Islands. From the U.S., there are direct flights from cities like Washington, D.C., New York, Miami, and Toronto. \\n All flights arrive at the Providenciales International Airport (PLS). From there, visitors can fly Caicos Express or InterCaribbean for inter-island travel. Both offer daily flights. \\n Many visitors arrive via cruise ships, which dock at the islands\\' only cruise ship terminal, the Grand Turk Cruise Center at the southern end of Grand Turk. Inter-island travel is also possible by boat. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Visit\\n\\n Providenciales: Locally known as \"Provo,\" 38-square-mile Providenciales is the most developed and populated of the islands and is the hub of tourism and hotels. It\\'s home to Grace Bay Beach, which has been named \"the world\\'s best beach,\" and Providenciales International Airport (PLS). Grace Bay is one of the most central and commercialized areas of the islands. \\n North Caicos: Half of the \"twin islands\" of North and Middle Caicos (connected to Middle Caicos by a causeway, so the two pretty much function as one), North Caicos is the country\\'s second-largest island. It\\'s a 30-minute ferry ride from Providenciales, making it popular for day trips. The only hotel on North Caicos is the family-owned boutique Pelican Beach Hotel. \\n Middle Caicos: Middle Caicos makes up the other half of the \"twin islands\" and is the largest island in Turks and Caicos, but is sparsely populated, with only about 275 residents. Visitors go to Middle Caicos to check out Indian Cave and Conch Bar Cave. Dragon Cay Resort, which has five Caribbean-style cottages, three villas, and an on-site restaurant overlooking the Mudjin Harbor, is the only resort-style accommodation option on Middle Caicos. \\n South Caicos: Located a 90-minute ferry ride or 20-minute flight from Providenciales, South Caicos is 18 square miles and is known for its great fishing, birdwatching, snorkeling, and scuba diving. There are some luxury stays available on South Caicos, but it is one of the less commercialized islands, with lots of untouched land and wildlife. \\n Grand Turk: Grand Turk is home to the capital of Turks and Caicos, Cockburn Town, and is the second most populous island in the chain. Visitors love Grand Turk for its heritage, culture, and rustic charm as well as its diving. Founded by settlers in the late 1600s, Cockburn Town was the historic center of the island, though now most of the government and commerce activities take place in Providenciales. \\n Salt Cay: For a rugged experience off the beaten path, Salt Cay is the answer: there are no paved roads and only 80 residents call this tiny island home (it clocks in at just under three square miles). People get around via golf cart and there are remnants of the island\\'s salt-industry past all over. It\\'s also the best place for whale watching in the Turks and Caicos islands. \\n Pine Cay: Pine Cay is a tiny 800-acre island between North Caicos and Providenciales. Like Salt Cay, there are no cars on Pine Cay. It\\'s home to two miles of untouched beaches, a few private homes, and The Meridian Club, a luxury private island resort with just 13 rooms. \\n Parrot Cay: Parrot Cay is a private island resort, home to COMO Parrot Cay, and spans 1,000 acres with more than four miles of beach. Visitors get there via a 25-minute boat ride from Providenciales. \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n There is no public transportation on the islands but you can easily get around by taxi, car service, or renting a car. \\n Taxis: Taxis — available on Providenciales, Grand Turk, and North and Middle Caicos — are typically quite expensive. Most are large vans that operate on a shared basis with other travelers going in the same direction, though private taxis are available at a higher rate. The tourism board recommends Sea Breeze Taxi and Tours and Liv Transport, as other companies have been known to overcharge tourists. Conch Cab is another popular taxi service that can be booked by app — it is similar to Uber but only operates on Providenciales. \\n Car service: If you want private transportation, then Fast Track TCI is the way to go. With larger groups, it can be more affordable than taxis. \\n Car or scooter rental: If you want transportation at your fingertips, consider renting a scooter or car. Just remember that motorists drive on the left, there are no stop lights anywhere in the country (roundabouts are used instead), and the speed limit is 40 mph on highways and 20 mph through settlements. Most car rental brands (think Avis, Hertz, Enterprise, Dollar, and Payless) have a presence on the islands, and the tourism board recommends Scooter Bob\\'s or Avis Turks & Caicos for renting scooters. \\n',\n",
              "  'There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to Vancouver, Canada. It\\'s too cold, it rains all the time, it gets so dark, etc. Not only are these preconceived notions misguided, Vancouver actually has some of the most temperate weather in the entire country, making it an ideal destination to play, explore, and have adventures inside and out. \\n Once you realize you\\'re not going to be swept away by freezing rain year-round, you can begin digging into the wide variety of things to see, do, eat, and explore. Canada\\'s third largest city is a multicultural hub with stunning architecture that sits on the Strait of Georgia and is surrounded by epic mountains and lush green forests. \\n Because of its natural beauty, the city is set up for outdoor adventurers, whether cruising the streets of one of the largest Chinatowns in the world, riding bikes along the city\\'s seawall, or hiking in nearby woodlands for some of the freshest air on earth. \\n Vancouver is a city that is proud of its diversity, its indigenous history, and its tolerance. Davie Village is a neighborhood in the city\\'s West End where a thriving LGBTQ+ community comes out to play, while the city also boasts the third-largest urban Indigenous population in all of Canada. \\n So, throw your mistaken beliefs out the window and think about booking a ticket to Canada\\'s western hub, you will not regret it. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Pacific Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n There aren\\'t any bad times to go to Vancouver, but because it\\'s a northern city, there are reasons for every season. The summer months draw in the most tourists and boast the longest daylight hours, but the winter (which is surprisingly mild) is the least crowded time of year and has sprouting trees and flowers as early as February. Keep in mind that the rainiest months are from November to March, which leaves the month of September as the most idyllic time with changing leaves, cooling temps, and dry skies to get outside. \\n If you\\'re into whale watching, April through November is prime time. For events and festivals, think about Chinese New Year, which lands between January and February, the Vancouver Marathon in May, Vancouver International Jazz Festival in June, or the Vancouver Pride Parade in July or August. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n One of the best things about Vancouver is how easy it is to get around. Not only is the city incredibly walkable and bike-able, but there is also a plethora of public transit options. Don\\'t bother renting a car here as hotel parking is pricey and taxis, buses, ferries, trains, and ride-share apps make moving around a cinch. Check out this handy transit guide by the Vancouver Tourism Board. \\n Another great item to note about Vancouver is that the city boasts 550 separate locations with free WiFi service. Look for the #VanWifi public network to connect in case you need touring advice at your fingertips. Also, if you\\'re visiting Vancouver from the United States, you do not need an adapter for your electronics as all of Canada runs on standard 120 V. \\n As far as the geography of the city, Vancouver is broken up into neighborhoods. Popular hoods include the Downtown Centre, which is in the middle of the city; Gastown, which is known as the historic quarter filled with cobblestoned streets and trendy restaurants; Kitsilano for the beach and water enthusiasts; Yaletown for high-end shopping and eating; Chinatown for great eats and sites; and the West End, which leads outdoor lovers to the expansive Stanley Park. \\n Lastly, Vancouver is considered one of the safest cities in the world.

              "  'Canals, gondolas, and the Rialto Bridge. You think you know what to expect from Venice, but it turns out that no photo, however digitally enhanced, can hold a candle to the real city. To get to know it, though, requires more than an afternoon. While the day-trippers are stampeding from the Rialto to St Mark\\'s Square, you should be a block or two away, watching artisans craft items with Renaissance techniques, seeing shimmering reflections dancing on bridge arches, and gawking at marble-clad buildings each more fantastical than the next. The joy of Venice is getting lost, they say – although however far you amble, you\\'re never more than a couple of churches away from a Titian or Tintoretto. \\n Don\\'t stick to the city, though – that getting lost should also be done in the lagoon, taking the vaporetto (ferry) to the beach-filled Lido, island of glass Murano, and, further out, Torcello and Burano, where Venice began 1600 years ago. You could spend a lifetime here and never do Venice justice. But with just a few days, it can touch your soul. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Standard Time \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n If you\\'re wanting to escape the crowds, there\\'s no better time than winter, when visitor numbers are at their lowest. But while there\\'s a romance to it, Venice in winter with its biting cold, swirling fog, and frequent wind and rain certainly isn\\'t the Venice of people\\'s dreams. In summer, the city is crowded and hot – but it\\'s also the perfect time to head to the beach on the Lido, or into the lagoon. Spring and fall tend to have the best of both worlds – go late March to mid April, Easter aside, and you should enjoy decent weather but not too many crowds. Christmas tends to be quiet but New Year is busy, and Carnival (roughly mid January to mid February) is packed. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Know\\n\\n Currency: Euro(Check the current exchange rate) \\n Language: Italian \\n I don\\'t speak Italian: Non parlo Italiano \\n I\\'m lost: Mi sono perso/a \\n I would like…: Vorrei… \\n How much is…: Quanto costa…: \\n How do you get to…: Per andare a…: \\n Learn more Italian phrases \\n Calling Code: +39 \\n Capital City: Rome \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: Venice has two main train stations, Venezia Santa Lucia and Venezia Mestre, but only long distance trains stop at the former while local trains go to the later. \\n Buses: The vaporetto is the public transit system in the city and operates on 20 different lines all through town. The water buses run the length of the Grand Canal and cost €7.50 per ride, and are good for 75 minutes.

Ground taxis (a car) can take you from the airport to Piazzale Roma for considerably less. \\n Car service: Hotels can arrange transfers, usually with water taxis. \\n Gondola: While more of a scenic mode of transportation rather than a pragmatic one, Gondola rides are synonymous with Venice and shouldn\\'t be missed. Daytime rates are usually around €80 ($95) or €100 ($120) at night, excluding tip. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Hotels\\n\\n Address: S.

The Istituto Canossiano San Trovaso, run by nuns in arty Dorsoduro, is as close as they get to hotels: large, comfy rooms in a 17th-century building, at a fraction of the price of similar-standard hotels. You don\\'t get breakfast, but there\\'s a communal kitchen; and you don\\'t need to be religious, but must be ok with a Madonna and Child over the bed. \\n Address: Calle Avogaria, 1629, 30100 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 296 0491Book Now \\n You\\'ll feel like a real Venetian in this five-room B&B at the quieter end of Dorsoduro.

And it\\'s a goodie: a grand palazzo with a rare modern interior and two private courtyards to escape the crowds. Even better? Its front-facing rooms (and roof terrace) have the same lagoon views as those around St Mark\\'s but its location, a 10-minute walk up the famous Riva degli Schiavoni, by the Arsenale vaporetto stop, means it\\'s beautifully peaceful. \\n Address: Riva degli Schiavoni, 4196, 30122 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 522 6480Book Now \\n This, the former home of a 14th-century doge (plus two more modern annexes), is the Venetian grande dame par excellence. Sit back in the bar – the original doge\\'s atrium, with Corinthian columns and a grand coffered ceiling. Eat on the rooftop overlooking the lagoon at Terrazza Danieli.

But instead of heading to Harry\\'s Bar, where it was invented, hop on the vaporetto to Giudecca, where you\\'ll find sister restaurant Harry\\'s Dolci. You\\'ll get the same Bellinis and fish-filled Cipriani menu; only with spectacular waterside views from the outdoor tables. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Things to Do\\n\\n The vaporetto (waterbus) lines plying the zigzagging Grand Canal double as spectacular cruises. Hop on the number 1 at Piazzale Roma or the station, and wiggle your way down past marble-clad palaces, each more ornate than the other, before sailing under the Rialto Bridge, past St Mark\\'s Square and the Doge\\'s Palace, and alighting at San Zaccaria. \\n Most visitors to Venice come for one thing only: the breathtaking, waterside St Mark\\'s Square. Have coffee in one of the chi-chi cafes outside (we recommend Quadri), visit the Basilica di San Marco, the church covered head-to-toe in glittering gold mosaics, and stroll along the Riva degli Schiavoni waterfront, for those classic lagoon views. \\n Address: P.za San Marco, 1, 30124 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 271 5911Website \\n Overlooking the waterfront, this stunning palace – which was the seat of power for the ancient Venetian Republic — showcases an astonishing mix of artistic masterpieces and grand architecture, including the famous Bridge of Sighs. Take the Secret Itineraries Tour to get guided around the prisons and other rooms not otherwise open to the public – you\\'re then free to continue the rest of your visit alone. \\n Address: Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore \\n Admire the Tintorettos in the vast church below, then take the elevator to the top of the belltower on this island monastery. From here, you\\'ll have spectacular views of Venice – go at sunset to see the lagoon flush pink beneath you. \\n Address: Campo Santa Maria Formosa, 5252, 30122 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 271 1411Website \\n Only time for one museum in Venice? Make it this one, a former noble\\'s house, stuffed with works by the likes of Bellini, Tiepolo, and Pietro Longhi upstairs, and a ground-floor wing and garden designed by 20th-century architect Carlo Scarpa where the canal is encouraged in to lap against specially constructed channels. \\n Get a vaporetto (ferry) to these two islands 40 minutes outside Venice. Fishing town Burano\\'s multicolored houses make it an Instagram paradise (go early or late to discover the real town), while semi-deserted Torcello, where Venice began, is known for the Byzantine mosaics in the basilica of Santa Maria Assunta. \\n Phone: +39 333 904 3172Website \\n Spend the afternoon with Andrea Rossi, one of Burano\\'s best fishermen, who\\'ll show you the hidden corners of the lagoon in his boat.

The top floor of this building is covered entirely – yes, even the ceiling – in his paintings, making it an artwork in itself. \\n Website \\n Venice\\'s churches are living museums, with masterpieces usually in situ. Fifteen of the best make up the Chorus group – buy an open-access ticket (valid for 12 months) so you can pop in to see Tintoretto in San Polo, and Canova\\'s tomb in the Frari church, as you walk around. \\n Phone: +39 349 084 8303Website \\n Venice\\'s artisans have a proud history, with many crafts dating back to medieval times and earlier. These days, they\\'re endangered – so take a tour with guide Luisella Romeo, who\\'ll take you to meet glass-blowers, mask-makers and gold-beaters. \\n The 20-minute walk along the waterfront of Giudecca, the island squaring off against the city center, nets you some of the city\\'s most iconic views, with St Mark\\'s and the round Salute church always in the background. This is also one of the least touristy areas, so follow the locals into bars for a spritz along the way. \\n If it\\'s sunny, blow off steam from all that culture with a trip to the Lido, the long sandbar off Venice city center. The deep-sanded beach is incredible, here – head west for the free section, away from the sunbeds. \\n Yes, it\\'s expensive. Yes, it\\'s worth it – Venice was built to be seen from the water. But don\\'t rent one on the Grand Canal; instead, you want to be going along the small waterways where you can\\'t get by public transport and the only sound is the slosh of water on the boat. Start from the train station for an off-the-beaten-track itinerary. \\n Address: San Marco, 5541, 30124 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 314 2000Website \\n Work your way through this department store in a 16th-century building by the Rialto Bridge, up to the rooftop.

Antonin, 3478/A, 30122 Venezia VE, ItalyPhone: +39 041 522 1439Website \\n Pure woollen coats, silk jackets, and summer dresses, all with a vintage feel – they\\'re all handmade by inmates of the women\\'s jail on Giudecca.

You\\'ll find it here at the city\\'s best-loved bookstore since 1933. It has a huge English-language section of guides, Venice-set novels and cicchetti cookbooks. \\n Michela Buttignol/Travel+Leisure \\n \\n\\nHeading: Neighborhoods to Know\\n\\n San Marco: Once the political heart of Venice, San Marco is now the most visited of Venice\\'s six sestieri, or districts. Piazza San Marco, or St Mark\\'s Square, is the center; radiating out around it is a rabbit warren of narrow calli (streets), taking you to the Rialto Bridge. There are gems here, but this is definitely the tourist trail. \\n San Polo: On the other side of the Rialto from San Marco, this is Venice at its most medieval, with squeezebelly alleyways, sottoporteghi (cut-out passageways underneath first-floor houses) and timber-framed palazzos. Although heavily trodden, there are still artisans around, and it has a young feel, thanks to its proximity to university Ca\\' Foscari. \\n Dorsoduro: Traditionally the artists\\' area, Dorsoduro — the \"hard back\" of Venice, forming the lower border of the city center — is less boho than it was, but you\\'ll still find high-end galleries and bijou shops around the Guggenheim Museum. It\\'s a popular area with students around the vast, bar-lined square, Campo Santa Margherita, and the always-sunny Zattere waterfront is where locals love to stroll. \\n Castello: The biggest sestiere is also the hardest to pin down. Alleyways behind San Marco stuffed with restaurants and bars unfold into big, café-lined squares where local kids play football. Some of the loveliest churches are in Castello – like the marble-clad Santa Maria dei Miracoli – but this is a place for walking, along the Riva degli Schiavoni waterfront and around the Arsenale, where the Republic of Venice could knock out a warship in mere days. \\n Santa Croce: For the vast majority of visitors, Santa Croce is their first sight. But step away from the Piazzale Roma bus stops or the cruise terminal and one of the city\\'s most laid back areas is on the doorstep. This is one of the most residential areas still, and the quiet canals are worth a wander. This top end of the Grand Canal is less prestigious, but, because of that, more real. \\n Cannaregio: What was once an industrial area is now perhaps the loveliest sestiere, with wider canals, bigger pavements to lay seating on, and magnificent palazzos. Cannaregio has long been known for its artisans; today, the Fondamenta della Misericordia is the locals\\' favorite bar strip, while the Fondamente Nove waterfront, on the north of the lagoon, offers spectacular views of the Dolomites, as well as ferry boats to the islands.Giudecca and the islands: Life goes on as it always has on the islands, which give a different glimpse of lagoon life. Giudecca, the croissant–shaped island opposite Dorsoduro, has some of the best views in the city, while the Lido is one great, miles-long beach. In the north, past the cemetery island of San Michele, is Murano, known worldwide for its master glassblowers. Half an hour beyond it, into the north lagoon is the fishing island Burano, known for its multicolored houses, and Torcello, where two ancient basilicas mark where Venice began. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Weather\\n\\n Spring is the classic time to visit Venice, before the summer crowds (and heat) hit. Temperatures can hit 55°F in March and 70°F in May, but when the sun is out, it feels much hotter. Summer can be sweltering – although average temperatures are in the low-to-mid 80s, the humidity, which pushes 80 percent, makes everything much stickier. Fall tends to remain warm – average temperatures are 74°F for September and 64°F in October, again feeling warmer when the sun is out. Winter temperatures rarely hit freezing, though the high humidity, fog, and strong winds can make the city feel colder than other snowier cities. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Apps to Download\\n\\n CheBateo?

              "  'Vienna (Wien in German), Austria\\'s capital city, is rich in history, architecture, art, music, food, and wine. Located on the River Danube, Vienna dates back to a Roman era settlement. Most of the city\\'s many Baroque buildings were created under Empress Maria Theresa (18th century) and Emperor Franz Joseph (19th century), and today they stand in contrast to modern glass and steel structures. \\n Beautiful buildings, walkable streets, delicious food, and lots to do both indoors and outdoors make Vienna a wonderful vacation destination. Voted one of the most livable cities in the world, Vienna\\'s city limits include vineyards, parks, and the forested Vienna Woods (Wienerwald in German), a protected natural landscape. A dog-friendly city, Vienna permits dogs on public transportation as well as in restaurants and shops. The \"coffee culture\" features prominently in Viennese life, and coffee houses are places to relax, socialize, and enjoy the city\\'s famous desserts. \\n Called the \"City of Music,\" Vienna was home to classical composers Schubert, Mozart, Haydn, Strauss, Brahms, and Beethoven. Vienna is known for its Ball Season when, from November until the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, nearly 500 balls take place—with the Viennese Waltz and elegant formal attire in full display. \\n \\n\\nHeading: Time Zone\\n\\n Central European Time Zone (CET) UTC +1 \\n Seasonally: Central European Summer Time (CEST) UTC +2 \\n \\n\\nHeading: Best Time to Go\\n\\n For mild, although sometimes chilly weather, spring and fall are pleasant times to be in Vienna. Fewer tourists make it easier to see the city\\'s attractions, and hotel rates are lower. Summer is warm and sunny with temperatures in the high 70s and perhaps a bit more rain. It\\'s also a lovely time there, but the city sees more visitors during the high season, reflected in hotel prices. \\n Christmas markets and magical decorations attract tourists in winter, despite colder temperatures.

And if you\\'re looking for stunning views but don\\'t want to deal with the crowds at the Washington Monument, Kevin Fanning recommends you head to the old post office and clock tower, located on the corner of 11th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. \"The clock tower goes up 257 feet, giving you unparalleled views of Pennsylvania Avenue. You don\\'t need tickets to go to the top, as it is owned and operated by the National Park Service.\" \\n Georgetown: The neighborhood around Georgetown University is more than just your classic college enclave. You\\'ll find upscale restaurants and hotels along the C&O Canal, luxury shopping on M Street, and historic homes dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. \\n Capitol Hill: Home to the U.S. Capitol building, the Supreme Court building, and the U.S. House and Senate, this neighborhood is the political epicenter of our country. You\\'ll find plenty of tourists and the political working crowd here, some of whom reside in the lovely 19th-century Capitol Hill row houses. \\n The Wharf: This trendy neighborhood is helping to reestablish D.C. as a waterfront destination. Crouch says you can have the ultimate D.C. experience in this neighborhood. \"Start with a bit of shopping at Shop Made in D.C., where everything is made by local makers.\\xa0Next door is a branch of Politics & Prose, one of Washington\\'s favorite independent bookstores.\\xa0Across the way is Surfside, a locally owned taco stand with an island vibe.\\xa0For dessert, head over to the family-owned and -operated Southwest Soda Pop Shop for\\xa0homemade ice cream and vegan soft serve.\" \\n \\n\\nHeading: How to Get Around\\n\\n Trains: The city\\'s Metrorail, run by Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), operates across Washington, D.C. and into parts of Virginia and Maryland. It has six lines — yellow, orange, red, blue, green, and silver. Metrorail rides cost anywhere between $2 and $6, depending on where you\\'re traveling and when. You can also buy a one-day pass for $13, a three-day pass for $28, and a seven-day pass for $58. Download the WMATA SmartTrip App to plan your metro and bus trips, and pay in advance. \\n Buses: The city\\'s Metrobus system, also run by WMATA, will change drastically in the coming years for the very first time since the network\\'s creation in 1973. WMATA has created Better Bus, an initiative meant to completely revitalize the bus system. Changes will include the integration of new bus lanes, new transit signals, and better service times and locations that reflect the needs of D.C. residents. The project is still in its planning stage, but changes are set to roll out in 2024. \\n Taxis and Car Service: Uber and Lyft are available in the greater Washington, D.C. area, and there are taxi stands spread out across the city. To schedule a cab in advance, book through a local company like D.C. Yellow Cab. You can also schedule a local black car through services like ExecuCar. \\n Cars: Driving in the capital city isn\\'t necessary because the public transportation system is so comprehensive, but you can download apps like SpotHero to find and reserve parking spaces all across the city if necessary. \\n']}"
